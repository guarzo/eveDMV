# EVE DMV Development Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: January 13, 2025  
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 5 - System Intelligence & Universal Search (Started)  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done. If it's not done, don't ship it."

## 📊 Implementation Reality Dashboard

### ✅ Actually Working Features
- **Kill Feed** (`/feed`) - Real-time display with wanderer-kills SSE integration
- **Character Analysis** (`/character/:character_id`) - Complete analysis with intelligence summary, ship preferences, weapon tracking
- **Corporation Intelligence** (`/corporation/:corporation_id`) - Member activity, timezone analysis, participation metrics, activity heatmaps
- **Performance Caching** - ETS-based cache for character and corporation analysis (15-min TTL)
- **Static Data Loading** - 49,894 items including all EVE ships and weapon lookups
- **Authentication** - EVE SSO OAuth integration
- **Database** - PostgreSQL with partitioning and proper indexes  
- **Broadway Pipeline** - Processing ~50-100 killmails/minute reliably
- **Monitoring Dashboard** (`/monitoring`) - Error tracking, pipeline health, missing data alerts

### 🚧 Placeholder Features (Return Mock Data)
- **Battle Analysis** - Returns empty arrays
- **Fleet Composition Tools** - All calculations return 0
- **Wormhole Features** - Mock data only
- **Surveillance Profiles** - Database exists but no functionality
- **Price Integration** - Tables exist but APIs not connected
- **System Intelligence** - Not yet implemented (Sprint 5 target)

## ✅ Completed Sprints

### Reality Check Sprint 1 (December 2024)
**Goal**: Establish honest baseline and fix critical infrastructure  
**Result**: SUCCESS - Fixed core issues, established "no mock data" rule

**Key Achievements**:
- Identified ~80% of features were returning placeholder data
- Fixed Broadway pipeline (was returning list instead of single message)
- Loaded static data (18,348 items + 8,436 solar systems)
- Eliminated all compilation warnings
- Updated stub services to return `{:error, :not_implemented}`

### Sprint 3: Polish & Stabilize (January 2025)
**Goal**: Fix runtime errors and polish Character Intelligence  
**Result**: EXCEEDED - 31/30 points delivered

**Key Achievements**:
- **Removed foreign key constraints** causing participant insertion failures
- **Simplified architecture** by completely removing enriched killmail table
- **Polished Character Analysis page** with proper images and real data
- **Fixed static data loading** - now have all 49,894 EVE items
- **Added monitoring improvements** - tracking missing ship types and errors

### Sprint 4: Corporation Intelligence MVP (January 2025)
**Goal**: Build working Corporation Intelligence with real member activity data  
**Result**: SUCCESS - 23/23 points delivered (100% completion)

**Key Achievements**:
- **Corporation Intelligence page** with real member data, timezone analysis, participation metrics
- **Activity heatmaps** showing 24-hour corporation activity distribution  
- **Performance caching layer** (ETS-based) for character and corporation analysis
- **Character analysis enhancements** - intelligence summary, clickable fight partners, weapon name resolution
- **Architecture migration** - All queries converted from direct SQL to proper Ash framework queries
- **Bug fixes** - Fixed partition manager errors, type conversion issues, compilation warnings

## 🚀 Current Sprint: Sprint 5 - System Intelligence & Universal Search

**Goal**: Build working System Intelligence with citadel tracking and universal search functionality  
**Duration**: January 13-27, 2025 (2 weeks)  
**Points**: 32 planned

### Sprint Focus
- System overview pages with real activity statistics
- Citadel and structure kill tracking with proper categorization
- System danger assessment algorithm
- Universal search with auto-completion for all entity types
- Updated index page with universal search replacing character intel links
- NO mock data, NO placeholder values

See `/workspace/docs/sprints/current/SPRINT_5_SYSTEM_INTELLIGENCE.md` for details.

## 📈 Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Compilation Warnings**: 0
- **Runtime Errors Fixed**: 2 major patterns eliminated
- **Placeholder Features Removed**: Enriched killmail table and related code (~500 lines)

### Performance
- **Pipeline Throughput**: 50-100 killmails/minute
- **Character Analysis Load Time**: <2 seconds
- **Database Size**: ~800K killmails, properly partitioned

### Architecture Simplification
- **Before**: Raw → Enriched → UI (complex, error-prone)
- **After**: Raw → UI (simple, working)

## 🔄 Development Process

1. **Identify Problem** - What's actually broken?
2. **Simplify Solution** - Remove complexity, not add it
3. **Test with Real Data** - No mock values
4. **Document Reality** - Update docs to match implementation
5. **Ship Working Code** - If it's not done, don't merge it

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Simpler is Better** - Removing enriched table eliminated entire categories of errors
2. **Fix Root Causes** - Static data issues were causing downstream problems
3. **Honest Assessment** - Admitting what doesn't work enables fixing it
4. **Incremental Progress** - Small working features > large broken ones
