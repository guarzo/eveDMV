## 🔄 Development Process

1. **Identify Problem** - What's actually broken?
2. **Simplify Solution** - Remove complexity, not add it
3. **Test with Real Data** - No mock values
4. **Document Reality** - Update docs to match implementation
5. **Ship Working Code** - If it's not done, don't merge it

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Simpler is Better** - Removing enriched table eliminated entire categories of errors
2. **Fix Root Causes** - Static data issues were causing downstream problems
3. **Honest Assessment** - Admitting what doesn't work enables fixing it
4. **Incremental Progress** - Small working features > large broken ones
