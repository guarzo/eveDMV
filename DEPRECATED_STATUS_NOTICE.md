# üö® DEPRECATED STATUS DOCUMENTS

The following documents contain **inaccurate claims** about project functionality and should not be used for project planning or assessment:

## Deprecated Documents (DO NOT USE)
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Claims 84+ story points completed (reality: ~15)
- `docs/project-management/project-status.md` - Multiple sprint claims with fake deliveries
- `docs/sprints/*.md` - Sprint documents claiming non-existent features

## ‚ùå Why These Documents Are Wrong
- Features marked "complete" when only UI existed
- Business logic was placeholder/mock data  
- Claims not verified through manual testing
- Test suite didn't validate real functionality

## ‚úÖ Use These Instead
- **[PROJECT_STATUS_REALISTIC.md](./PROJECT_STATUS_REALISTIC.md)** - Honest current status
- **[ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md](./ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md)** - Technical reality assessment
- **[DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)** - Current sprint tracking
- **[docs/HONEST_PROJECT_STATUS.md](./docs/HONEST_PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - Detailed assessment

## üéØ The Reality
- **Claimed Progress**: 84+ story points across multiple sprints
- **Actual Progress**: ~12-15 story points of working functionality
- **Core Issue**: 80% of "completed" features were returning mock data

## üìã Development Rule Going Forward
**"If it returns mock data, it's not done. If it's not done, don't ship it."**

All future documentation will be evidence-based and manually verified before claims are made.
