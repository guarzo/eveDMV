  {:ok, %{total_value: 0, destroyed_value: 0, dropped_value: 0}}
end

# ✅ ACCEPTABLE - This is done
def calculate_killmail_value(killmail) do
  with {:ok, items} <- fetch_killmail_items(killmail.id),
       {:ok, prices} <- PriceService.get_prices(items) do
    total = calculate_total_from_prices(items, prices)
    {:ok, %{total_value: total, destroyed_value: destroyed, dropped_value: dropped}}
  end
end
