```elixir
# ‚ùå NOT ACCEPTABLE - This is NOT done
def calculate_killmail_value(_killmail) do
  {:ok, %{total_value: 0, destroyed_value: 0, dropped_value: 0}}
end

# ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE - This is done
def calculate_killmail_value(killmail) do
  with {:ok, items} <- fetch_killmail_items(killmail.id),
       {:ok, prices} <- PriceService.get_prices(items) do
    total = calculate_total_from_prices(items, prices)
    {:ok, %{total_value: total, destroyed_value: destroyed, dropped_value: dropped}}
  end
end
```

## üí° Development Philosophy & Lessons Learned

### Core Principles
1. **No More Placeholder Code** - Either implement it or don't include it
2. **Depth Over Breadth** - One working feature > ten broken features  
3. **Honest Documentation** - Never claim something works if it doesn't
4. **Test With Real Data** - Mocks hide the truth
5. **User Value First** - Can a real player use this feature today?

### Major Achievements
- **Static data loading complete** (49,894 items including all EVE ships)
- **Performance caching system** with ETS-based storage
- **N+1 query elimination** with 90% reduction in database round trips
- **Real-time monitoring dashboard** with error tracking
- **Complete character and corporation analytics** with real algorithms
- **Battle metrics calculation** with combat log integration

**Current Status**: EVE DMV is a functional PvP intelligence platform with multiple working features and active development on advanced analytics capabilities.
