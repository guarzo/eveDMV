# üöÄ EVE DMV - Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 9, 2025  
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 6 - Battle Analysis MVP  
**Project Phase**: Advanced Features Development

> **‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE**: This document has been updated to reflect actual implementation status.  
> Previous versions contained inaccurate claims. See `DEPRECATED_STATUS_NOTICE.md` for details.

## üìä Honest Progress Assessment

### Reality Check (January 2025)
After comprehensive codebase audit, we discovered:
- **Previously Claimed**: 84+ story points across multiple sprints
- **Actually Working**: ~12-15 story points of real functionality  
- **Core Issue**: 80% of "completed" features were returning mock data

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Technical Foundation**: Solid infrastructure complete
- üöß **Reality Check Sprint 1**: Stabilization (Week 1 complete)
- üìã **Next**: Character Intelligence MVP (first real feature)

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

### Core Infrastructure (VERIFIED)
- **Phoenix 1.7.21** with LiveView ‚úÖ
- **Broadway pipeline** processing killmails from wanderer-kills SSE ‚úÖ  
- **PostgreSQL** with partitioned tables and extensions ‚úÖ
- **EVE SSO OAuth2** authentication ‚úÖ
- **Static Data Loading** - 18,348 item types + 8,436 solar systems ‚úÖ

### Working Features (MANUALLY TESTED)
1. **Kill Feed** (`/feed`) ‚úÖ
   - Real-time killmail display
   - Actual data from wanderer-kills SSE feed
   - Working authentication integration

2. **Authentication System** ‚úÖ
   - EVE SSO login/logout functional
   - Character data stored in session
   - Protected routes work correctly

3. **Database Infrastructure** ‚úÖ
   - PostgreSQL with proper extensions
   - Ash Framework resource management
   - Broadway killmail ingestion pipeline

## üî¥ What Doesn't Work (But Was Previously Claimed)

### Character Intelligence (`/intel/:character_id`)
**Status**: PLACEHOLDER UI ONLY
- All analysis functions return `{:error, :not_implemented}`
- No real killmail analysis algorithms
- UI exists but shows no meaningful data
- **Previous False Claim**: "Hunter-focused tactical analysis"

### Battle Analysis System
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Services return `:not_implemented`
- No engagement detection or tactical analysis
- **Previous False Claim**: Multiple sprint deliveries

### Market Intelligence & Wormhole Operations
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- All services return `:not_implemented`
- No market analysis, no wormhole tools
- **Previous False Claim**: "Janice API integration", "WH Corporation Management"

### Intelligence Scoring & Surveillance
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- All scoring algorithms return `:not_implemented`
- No threat assessment or surveillance matching
- **Previous False Claim**: "Threat Analysis Engine", "Enhanced Surveillance System"

## üîß Reality Check Sprint 1 (Current)

### Week 1 Completed ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Audited all stub implementations
- ‚úÖ Updated stubs to return `:not_implemented` instead of mock data
- ‚úÖ Fixed Broadway pipeline bugs
- ‚úÖ Eliminated all runtime warnings (25+ fixes)
- ‚úÖ Added PostgreSQL extensions via migration
- ‚úÖ Fixed test suite to handle `:not_implemented` responses (327 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Created honest documentation

### Week 2 Plan
- Day 9-10: Complete remaining service updates
- Day 11: Final test validation  
- Day 12: Update all documentation to reflect reality
- Day 13: Plan Character Intelligence MVP (first real feature)
- Day 14: Manual testing and verification

## üéØ Next Sprint: Character Intelligence MVP

### Goal: First Real Feature
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Objective**: Build ONE complete feature from scratch

### Feature Options (Pick One)
1. **Character Combat Analysis** - Real killmail data analysis
2. **Character Corporation History** - ESI-based corp tracking
3. **Character Activity Patterns** - Timezone and behavioral analysis

### Success Criteria
- Feature works with real EVE data (no mocks)
- Database queries return actual results
- UI displays real information
- Tests pass with real scenarios
- Performance acceptable for production
- Documentation matches implementation exactly
- Manual testing confirms full functionality

## üìä Test Suite Status

- **Total Tests**: 327 (all passing) ‚úÖ
- **Integration Tests**: 15 added to validate stub behavior
- **Coverage**: Tests verify services return `:not_implemented`
- **Quality**: High - tests don't lie about functionality

## üö® Development Standards

### Definition of "Done" (Non-Negotiable)
1. ‚úÖ Queries real data from database
2. ‚úÖ Uses actual algorithms (no hardcoded values)
3. ‚úÖ No placeholder/mock return values
4. ‚úÖ Tests exist and pass with real data
5. ‚úÖ Documentation matches implementation
6. ‚úÖ No TODO comments in production code
7. ‚úÖ Manual testing confirms functionality

## üîç How to Verify Claims

### Check What Works
```bash
# Start the application
mix phx.server

# Visit working features
open http://localhost:4010/feed        # Real killmails
open http://localhost:4010/auth/login  # EVE SSO

# Verify data
psql -h db -U postgres -d eve_tracker_gamma -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM killmails_raw;"

# Run tests
MIX_ENV=test mix test  # 327 passing tests
```

### Check What Doesn't Work
```bash
# Character intelligence shows placeholder data
open http://localhost:4010/intel/123456789

# Stub services return :not_implemented
iex -S mix phx.server
> EveDmv.Contexts.CombatIntelligence.Infrastructure.AnalysisCache.get_intelligence_scores(123)
{:error, :not_implemented}
```

## üìÅ Documentation Hierarchy

### Current (Use These)
- **[PROJECT_STATUS_REALISTIC.md](./PROJECT_STATUS_REALISTIC.md)** - Detailed honest status
- **[ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md](./ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md)** - Technical reality
- **[DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md](./DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)** - Sprint tracking

### Deprecated (Don't Use)
- `PROJECT_STATUS_OLD_CLAIMS.md` - Backup of inaccurate claims
- `docs/project-management/project-status.md` - Contains false sprint data
- `docs/sprints/*.md` - Sprint documents with non-existent features

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
- Features marked "complete" when only UI existed
- Business logic was placeholder/mock data
- Tests passed but didn't validate real functionality
- Documentation claimed features that didn't work

### What We Fixed
- ‚úÖ Honest error responses instead of mock data
- ‚úÖ Tests validate real behavior
- ‚úÖ Documentation matches implementation
- ‚úÖ Clear distinction between UI and working features

### Going Forward
- **Evidence-based development**: Every claim must be demonstrable
- **Complete features fully**: Better 1 working feature than 10 mock features
- **Regular reality checks**: Frequent manual testing
- **Honest communication**: Clear about what works vs. what's planned

---

**Bottom Line**: EVE DMV has excellent technical foundation. Now we build our first real feature to prove we can deliver value on this solid base.
