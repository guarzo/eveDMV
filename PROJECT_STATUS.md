# EVE DMV Project Status

Last Updated: June 29, 2025

## 🚀 Current Status: Sprint 1, Day 1

### ✅ What's Live and Working

#### Core Infrastructure
- **Phoenix 1.7.21** application with LiveView
- **Broadway pipeline** processing real-time killmails from wanderer-kills SSE feed
- **PostgreSQL** with partitioned tables for killmails (by month)
- **EVE SSO OAuth2** authentication
- **ETS caching** for performance

#### Features Implemented
1. **Live Kill Feed** (`/feed`)
   - Real-time killmail display
   - System statistics and hot zones
   - Clickable character names linking to intelligence
   - ISK value formatting and killmail age display

2. **Character Intelligence** (`/intel/:character_id`)
   - Hunter-focused tactical analysis
   - Ship usage patterns and typical fits
   - Associate tracking (who they fly with)
   - Geographic activity patterns
   - Weakness identification
   - Danger rating (1-5 stars)
   - Tabbed interface for easy navigation

3. **Static Data Management**
   - Automated loading on startup
   - Mix task: `mix eve.load_static_data [--force]`
   - EVE universe data cached in ETS

4. **External API Integrations**
   - **Janice API**: Market pricing with caching
   - **Mutamarket API**: Abyssal module pricing
   - **EVE ESI**: Name resolution and universe data
   - **Price Service**: Unified pricing with fallback chain

5. **Authentication**
   - EVE SSO login/logout
   - Character data stored in session
   - Protected routes with auth checks
