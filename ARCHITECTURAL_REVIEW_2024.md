# EVE DMV Architectural Review - December 2024

## Executive Summary

Following the successful completion of major architectural improvements (Intelligence Engine consolidation, unified cache architecture, repository patterns, and killmail pipeline simplification), this comprehensive review identifies the next phase of improvements to further enhance code maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Current Architecture State

### âœ… Recent Achievements
- **Intelligence Engine**: Consolidated 24+ analyzers into unified plugin architecture
- **Unified Cache**: Consolidated 93+ cache implementations to single EveDmv.Cache system
- **Repository Pattern**: Standardized database access with caching and telemetry
- **Killmail Pipeline**: Decoupled components with DataProcessor and async processing
- **Code Quality**: Reduced warnings from ~180 to ~60, fixed major compilation issues

### ðŸ“Š Current Metrics
- **Total Files**: ~300 Elixir files
- **Intelligence Directory**: 80+ files across deep nesting
- **Module Dependencies**: 122 files reference Intelligence modules
- **Test Coverage**: Varies by module (needs systematic assessment)
- **Compilation Warnings**: ~60 (mostly minor deprecations)

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Plugin Architecture**: Intelligence Engine provides excellent extensibility
2. **Data Processing**: Broadway pipeline handles high-volume killmail ingestion efficiently
3. **Caching Strategy**: Three-tier cache system (hot_data, api_responses, analysis)
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with .env support
5. **Real-time Features**: LiveView integration for responsive UI

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Module Organization Complexity
- **Issue**: 80+ files in intelligence directory with 4-5 levels of nesting
- **Impact**: Difficult navigation, unclear module boundaries
- **Files Affected**: `lib/eve_dmv/intelligence/**/*`

#### 2. Inconsistent Patterns
- **Error Handling**: Mix of `{:ok, result}`, exceptions, and custom error types
- **Configuration**: Scattered across 15+ files with different patterns
- **Data Flow**: Some modules bypass established patterns

#### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Logging**: Inconsistent across modules (some use Logger.warn vs Logger.warning)
- **Telemetry**: Ad-hoc metrics collection
- **Error Reporting**: No unified error tracking

#### 4. Business Logic Placement
- **Issue**: Business logic mixed into LiveViews and web controllers
- **Impact**: Difficult testing, poor separation of concerns
- **Examples**: `/lib/eve_dmv_web/live/surveillance_live.ex`
