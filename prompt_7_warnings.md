# Prompt 7: Fix Compiler Warnings and Unused Code

## Task
Address all remaining compiler warnings, unused variables, imports, and other code hygiene issues.

## Context
After fixing the major credo issues, there may be remaining compiler warnings and unused code that needs to be cleaned up.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Unused Variables
1. Find variables that are assigned but never used
2. Either:
   - Use the variables appropriately
   - Remove the assignments if they're not needed
   - Prefix with `_` if they're required for pattern matching but not used

### Part 2: Unused Imports and Aliases
1. Find unused `import`, `alias`, and `require` statements
2. Remove them to clean up the namespace
3. Check for:
   - Imported functions that are never called
   - Aliased modules that are never referenced
   - Required modules that provide unused macros

### Part 3: Unreachable Code
1. Find code paths that can never be executed
2. Remove dead code or fix the logic that makes it unreachable

### Part 4: Pattern Matching Issues
1. Find incomplete pattern matches
2. Add catch-all clauses where appropriate
3. Ensure all possible cases are handled

## Files to Focus On
Run these commands to identify issues:
```bash
# Check for compilation warnings
mix compile --warnings-as-errors

# Check for unused imports
mix credo --strict

# Look for specific patterns
grep -r "_unused\|# TODO\|@deprecated" lib/
```

## Common Patterns to Fix
- `def function(param) do` where `param` is never used → `def function(_param) do`
- `alias Module` that's never referenced → Remove the alias
- `import Module` where no functions are used → Remove the import
- Pattern matches that don't handle all cases → Add catch-all clauses

## Success Criteria
- No compiler warnings
- No unused variables, imports, or aliases
- All pattern matches are complete
- Code compiles cleanly with `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
- Credo analysis shows no remaining issues

## Important Notes
- This is a cleanup task focusing on code hygiene
- Be careful not to remove code that appears unused but is actually needed
- Test thoroughly to ensure no functionality is broken
- Some "unused" variables might be required for pattern matching
- Prefer prefixing with `_` over removal for pattern-matched variables
