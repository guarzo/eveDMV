# Prompt 1: Resolve TODO Comments

## Task
Fix all TODO comments in the codebase by removing placeholder implementations and replacing them with proper implementations or removing TODO comments that are no longer needed.

## Context
According to the credo analysis, there are 279 TODO comments throughout the codebase. These are marked as [D] (Design/Documentation) issues. The CLAUDE.md file explicitly states that TODO comments should not exist in completed implementations.

## Instructions
1. Search for all TODO comments in the codebase using: `grep -r "TODO:" lib/`
2. For each TODO comment, either:
   - Remove the TODO comment if the implementation is actually complete
   - Replace placeholder/mock implementations with real implementations
   - If the feature is not yet ready, convert the TODO into a proper issue or remove it entirely
3. Ensure no TODO comments remain in the final implementation
4. Focus on these key areas that have the most TODO comments:
   - Combat Intelligence modules
   - Wormhole Operations modules  
   - Intelligence Infrastructure modules
   - Surveillance modules
   - Battle Analysis modules

## Files to Focus On
Based on the credo output, prioritize these files with the most TODO comments:
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/combat_intelligence/domain/battle_analysis/battle_analysis_coordinator.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/wormhole_operations/domain/mass_optimizer.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/wormhole_operations/domain/home_defense_analyzer.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/wormhole_operations/domain/chain_intelligence_service.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/surveillance/domain/chain_intelligence_helper.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/intelligence_infrastructure/domain/cross_system/cross_system_coordinator.ex`

## Success Criteria
- All TODO comments are removed
- No placeholder/mock implementations remain
- All functions return real data or proper error handling
- Code compiles without warnings
- All tests pass

## Important Notes
- This is a documentation/design cleanup task
- DO NOT modify core functionality or business logic
- Focus on removing TODO comments, not implementing complex features
- If a TODO indicates a complex feature is missing, remove the TODO and leave a proper function stub
