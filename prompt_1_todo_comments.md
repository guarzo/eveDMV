# Fix TODO Comments and Design Issues (76 issues)

You are an AI assistant tasked with resolving Software Design issues found by Credo in an Elixir Phoenix codebase. Focus ONLY on [D] (Design) issues.

## Instructions

1. **TODO Comments**: Remove or implement the TODO comments found in the codebase. The TODO comments indicate placeholder implementations that need to be replaced with actual logic.

2. **Key TODO Issues to Address**:
   - `# TODO: Implement real vetting logic` in wormhole operations
   - `# TODO: Implement real focus fire analysis` in battle analysis
   - `# TODO: Implement real engagement flow analysis` in battle analysis  
   - `# TODO: Implement real turning point analysis` in battle analysis
   - `# TODO: Get from session/assigns when authentication is properly integrated` in surveillance profiles
   - `# TODO: Implement real fleet valuation` in market intelligence
   - `# TODO: Implement real killmail valuation` in market intelligence
   - `# TODO: Implement custom criteria and missing criteria types` in matching engine tests
   - `# TODO: Implement participant count criteria matching` in matching engine tests
   - `# TODO: Implement ISK value criteria matching` in matching engine tests

3. **For each TODO**:
   - If it's a stub implementation, replace with a basic working implementation
   - If it's test-related, either implement the test or remove the TODO if the feature isn't ready
   - If it's authentication-related, use a sensible default or proper session handling
   - Remove the TODO comment once resolved

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure all functions return appropriate types
   - Use proper error handling with `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` patterns
   - Follow Elixir conventions and existing patterns in the codebase
   - Don't break existing functionality

5. **Files to Focus On**:
   - `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/wormhole_operations.ex`
   - `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/combat_intelligence/domain/battle_analysis_service.ex`
   - `lib/eve_dmv_web/live/surveillance_profiles_live.ex` 
   - `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/market_intelligence/domain/valuation_service.ex`
   - `test/eve_dmv/contexts/surveillance/domain/matching_engine_test.exs`

## Important Notes

- This is part of a parallel fix effort - only modify files related to TODO comments
- Do NOT modify files that other prompts will handle (module aliasing, pipelines, number formatting, etc.)
- Run `mix test` after changes to ensure nothing breaks
- Focus on making the code functional rather than perfect - the goal is to remove TODO placeholders

## Success Criteria

- All TODO comments are either implemented or removed
- All tests pass
- No broken functionality
- Functions return proper Elixir types instead of placeholder values
