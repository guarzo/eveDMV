## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Maintenance Guidelines
- **Current Documents**: Keep up-to-date with implementation reality
- **Archived Documents**: Move outdated content to `archive/` folder
- **Consolidation**: Merge overlapping documents when possible
- **Organization**: Maintain logical folder structure

### Writing Standards
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting
- Reference related documents with relative links

### Update Process
- Update documentation as part of feature development
- Archive outdated content rather than deleting
- Consolidate overlapping information
- Review documentation organization quarterly
