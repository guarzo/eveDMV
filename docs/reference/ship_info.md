# EVE Online Fleet Ship Reference

Fleet doctrines in EVE Online often revolve around specific ship classes optimized for particular roles. Below is a detailed list of ships commonly fielded in medium to large-scale fleets, organized by category, along with their Type ID (from the Static Data Export) and typical fleet roles.

## Battleships (Mainline DPS and Support)
Megathron (Type ID: 641) – Gallente battleship known for its hybrid turrets. Often fit with railguns for long-range “alpha” volleys or blasters for close-range brawling. The Megathron has historically been a backbone of nullsec fleets as a sniper battleship, delivering high DPS under armor doctrines.
Apocalypse (Type ID: 642) – Amarr battleship and dedicated laser sniper. With excellent range bonuses, the Apocalypse is commonly used to engage at long distances (up to ~150km) in large fleet fights. In armor fleets, “Apoc” formations deal sustained beam laser damage from afar.
Tempest (Type ID: 639) – Minmatar battleship known for versatility and speed. Often fit with artillery for long-range volleys, the Tempest has been used as a fleet sniper in various doctrines. Its high-alpha strike (especially the Tempest Fleet Issue) made it a staple in early nullsec alpha fleets.
Maelstrom (Type ID: 24694) – Minmatar battleship with a strong shield tank and bonuses to large projectiles. Common in shield doctrines, the Maelstrom’s 1400mm artillery provides massive alpha damage. It was notably used in “alpha fleets” where synchronized volleys could instantly destroy targets.
Rokh (Type ID: 24688) – Caldari battleship specialized for railguns. The Rokh has very high engagement range and strong shield tank, making it ideal as a long-range fleet platform. Rokh fleets can project hybrid turret DPS at extreme ranges (often 200+ km) in large engagements.
Abaddon (Type ID: 24692) – Amarr battleship with monstrous armor and laser bonuses. The Abaddon is a premier heavy armor brawler, trading mobility for sheer tank. It’s popular in armor-heavy fleets as a frontline DPS ship that can soak damage
wiki.eveuniversity.org
. An Abaddon-based doctrine leverages its high resistance and laser damage in sustained battles.
Armageddon (Type ID: 643) – Amarr battleship featuring bonuses to energy neutralizers. In fleets, the Armageddon is often used as a support battleship to drain enemy capital/Logistics capacitors. Its ability to neut at range, combined with drones, makes it a threat to enemy sustain. (Commonly fielded in armor fleets as a “neut Geddon” platform.)
Scorpion (Type ID: 640) – Caldari battleship dedicated to electronic warfare (ECM). The Scorpion’s jammers can shut down enemy targeting; it is the only tech-1 ECM battleship and has been used to disrupt hostile logistics in large fights. Scorpions serve as specialized support, sacrificing damage for the ability to jam multiple enemies.
Dominix (Type ID: 645) – Gallente battleship with a vast drone bay and bonus to drone damage. The Dominix has seen use in drone-based fleet doctrines (“Domis”), where pilots assign sentry drones for synchronized volleys. It has also been fielded as a remote repair platform or heavy neut platform in some armor comps, leveraging its versatility with drones and utility highs.
Typhoon (Type ID: 644) – Minmatar battleship known for missile and torpedo tactics. It’s one of the faster battleships; Typhoons have been used in fleet roles as rapid damage dealers (e.g. cruise missile Typhoon fleets for long-range sustained DPS, or torpedo fits for burst damage). Its flexibility (damage type selection with missiles) makes it a strong choice in certain fleet metas.
Machariel (Type ID: 17738) – Pirate faction battleship (Angel cartel) famed for its speed and damage. The Machariel’s combination of battleship-class artillery and cruiser-like mobility made it the linchpin of many fast shield fleets. “Mach” fleets would use its high mobility to dictate range, delivering brutal volley damage with 800mm autocannons or artillery. This ship was a popular choice across multiple nullsec wars for hit-and-run tactics and quick repositioning.
Nightmare (Type ID: 17736) – Pirate faction battleship (Sansha’s Nation) with bonuses to lasers and shield tank. Often used in shield fleets, the Nightmare deals very high EM/Thermal damage with Tachyon beam lasers and boasts a strong capacitor. In fleets, Nightmares function as heavy shield brawlers or snipers (they were notably used in certain nullsec doctrines for their burst DPS and in Incursion PvE communities for efficient kills).
Bhaalgorn (Type ID: 17920 approx.) – Pirate faction battleship (Blood Raiders) specialized in energy neutralization and stasis webs. A Bhaalgorn in a fleet provides heavy support tackle: its overwhelming neutralizer strength can cap out enemy logistics or capital ships, and its long-range webs pin down targets. They appear in armor battleship fleets especially when facing capital threats, to drain and slow enemy supercapitals.
Leshak (Type ID: 47966 approx.) – Triglavian tech battleship armed with an Entropic Disintegrator. The Leshak’s weapon ramps up in damage over time, making it uniquely powerful in protracted fights. Leshak fleets (and allied remote rep “Spider tank” tactics) have been seen in certain conflicts and PvE Invasions, where their sustained DPS becomes devastating. They also bring utility with heavy remote armor repairs and neuting capability
wiki.eveuniversity.org
wiki.eveuniversity.org
. In large fleet battles, a wing of Leshaks can melt targets sequentially once their weapons spool to full damage.
(Many other battleships see use, but the above are among the most common. Faction variants like the Navy Issue Megathron or Apocalypse Navy Issue are occasionally used for improved performance, while tech II Marauders are rarely fielded in large fleets due to cost and vulnerability when sieged.)
Battlecruisers (Medium DPS platforms)
Ferox (Type ID: 20648) – Caldari battlecruiser with bonuses to hybrid turrets (railguns). The Ferox is a staple of many nullsec alliances’ doctrines, valued for its low cost and optimal range. A railgun Ferox fleet can project damage at 50–100km with decent tank, making it ideal for medium-sized fleet engagements. This reliable “line” ship frequently forms the backbone of newbie-friendly shield fleets.
Drake (Type ID: 24698) – Caldari battlecruiser known for its durability and missile firepower. The Drake’s thick shield tank and bonuses to heavy missiles spawned the infamous “Drake spam” era, where massive fleets of Drakes would saturate the field with missiles. In modern fleets, Drakes (or their Navy Issue variants) still serve as effective shield-tanked missile platforms that are easy to fly, providing sustained DPS with good range.
Hurricane (Type ID: 24702) – Minmatar battlecruiser, versatile with projectile weapons. Historically a workhorse of PvP, the Hurricane can fit artillery for long-range volleys or autocannons for mid-range brawling. Shield-tanked artillery Hurricanes were once common for hit-and-run tactics, and armor-tanked Hurricanes occasionally feature in armor brawler fleets. It remains a solid all-rounder for medium-scale engagements.
Harbinger (Type ID: 24696) – Amarr battlecruiser that fields lasers and armor tank. Harbingers see use in armor battlecruiser doctrines where their heavy pulse laser damage (bonus to optimal range) can be applied in mid-to-long range fights. While less ubiquitous than some counterparts, Harbingers offer strong DPS and a sturdy buffer, making them useful in armor brawling fleets or mixed-composition gangs.
Myrmidon (Type ID: 24700) – Gallente battlecruiser with a versatile drone bay and armor repair bonuses. In fleets the Myrmidon is less common, but when used it can act as a drone-based damage platform or even a pseudo-logi (with local reps). Some armor doctrines leverage Myrmidons for their hefty drone damage plus utility (e.g., carrying remote repair drones), though their primary role remains in smaller gang or as tackle bait in larger fights.
Oracle (Type ID: 4302) – Amarr attack battlecruiser designed to wield battleship-sized lasers. Oracles are utilized for long-range beam laser sniping or short-range pulse laser burst damage. In large fleet tactics, Oracle fleets (with beams) can alpha strike targets at extreme ranges like a glass cannon. Their high damage and range, offset by weak defenses, made them popular in the past for hit-and-fade volleys.
Naga (Type ID: 4306) – Caldari attack battlecruiser that can fit battleship-sized railguns or torpedo launchers. In fleet use, Nagas typically serve as long-range rail platforms (akin to mini-Rokhs) delivering solid kinetic/thermal volleys at range. Some groups field torpedo Nagas for burst damage against capitals at closer ranges. Like all attack BCs, they are fragile but pack a punch.
Talos (Type ID: ~4304) – Gallente attack battlecruiser focusing on blasters (or rails). A Talos in fleet context is usually fit with blasters to obliterate targets that come within medium range, acting as a high-DPS glass cannon. They are less commonly massed in null fleets (due to limited range), but might appear in fast-moving gangs where their overwhelming close-range DPS can delete targets that have been tackled.
Tornado (Type ID: ~4308) – Minmatar attack battlecruiser built for large artillery cannons. Tornados excel at alpha strike tactics: a group of artillery Tornados can one-volley fragile targets (like support cruisers or tackle) from long distance, then reposition. They have been widely used for hit-and-run and “ski sniper” roles (even outside fleet battles, e.g., gatecamping), and occasionally as part of hit-and-run doctrines in nullsec due to their 1400mm guns’ massive volley damage.
(Tech II Command Ships are covered separately below. Standard Tech I battlecruisers like the Cyclone, Brutix, and Prophecy are less common in large fleets, but may appear in faction warfare or as budget doctrine substitutes. Notably, the Brutix (Type ID: 16229) with blasters can be a brutal high-DPS brawler in smaller fleet engagements

.)
Command Ships (Fleet Boosters – Tech II Battlecruisers)
Command ships are T2 battlecruisers that provide command boosts (warfare links) to enhance the fleet, while often still packing decent combat ability. They are commonly used as on-grid boosters in medium/large fleets:
Damnation (Type ID: 22474) – Amarr Command Ship known for a colossal armor tank and armor warfare links. The Damnation is a premier fleet booster for armor fleets, thanks to its 3 warfare link capacity and extreme resilience. Fleet commanders often choose Damnations as command platforms to anchor the fleet, since they can survive heavy fire while projecting armor bonuses
wiki.eveuniversity.org
. (Its effective presence is such that in large armor doctrines you’ll nearly always see a Damnation providing armor resist and HP boosts.)
Vulture (Type ID: 22472) – Caldari Command Ship focusing on shield warfare links. With strong shield resist bonuses, the Vulture serves as the go-to shield fleet booster, improving the shield durability of the fleet. It also fields hybrid turrets with range bonuses, so a Vulture can contribute railgun fire. In large shield fleets (e.g., those centered on Feroxes or Rokhs), one or more Vultures usually sit at the center providing maximum shield resistance boosts to allies.
Claymore (Type ID: 22468) – Minmatar Command Ship oriented toward skirmish warfare bonuses (speed, agility, point range). Claymores are common in fast shield doctrines or nano-gang comp support, where their skirmish command bursts greatly enhance fleet mobility. A Claymore can significantly increase afterburner/MWD performance and tackle range for the fleet, often accompanying swift fleets like Muninns or nano-HACs.
Sleipnir (Type ID: 22466) – Minmatar Command Ship with bonuses to skirmish links and projectile weapons. Unlike the Claymore, the Sleipnir is a more combat-oriented command ship (essentially a beefed-up Hurricane), so it often serves dual duty as a high-DPS autocannon platform and as a booster. In some medium-scale shield fleets, Sleipnirs might form the main line, bringing both strong damage and commanding friendly ships’ speed/tackle enhancements.
Nighthawk (Type ID: 22470) – Caldari Command Ship focusing on shield boosts and heavy missiles. The Nighthawk is occasionally used in missile doctrines as a hard-hitting platform that can simultaneously boost shields. Its damage application and range (with heavy missiles) make it effective in smaller fleet actions, though in large fleets it’s more often overshadowed by the pure boosting role of the Vulture.
Eos (Type ID: 22472, note: Eos shares type ID listing with Vulture in the sequence) – Gallente Command Ship oriented to information warfare links (sensor strength, electronic warfare resistance) and drones. The Eos can boost sensor strength (to protect against ECM) or other EWAR-related aspects, which is more niche in fleet fights. However, it boasts a hefty drone bay and armor tank, so an Eos can add considerable drone DPS in armor fleets. It’s sometimes fielded to provide sensor integrity boosts against jamming or to act as a battlefield drone combat/boost hybrid.
Absolution (Type ID: 22476) – Amarr Command Ship with bonuses to armor links and lasers. Essentially a tougher Harbinger, the Absolution is a high-damage armor command ship. It can be used to boost armor (though the Damnation usually handles that in fleets) while adding significant laser DPS. Some armor doctrines favor Absolutions as frontline brawlers when raw damage is needed in addition to command boosts.
Astarte (Type ID: 22466, same sequence as Sleipnir) – Gallente Command Ship with bonuses to skirmish/armor links (historically) and blasters. The Astarte is a brutal close-range brawler that can lead an armor or hybrid doctrine from the front. In practice it’s less seen in modern null fleets, but when fielded, an Astarte provides command bonuses and heavy blaster firepower to punch through targets at close range.
(In summary, command ships are often present as dedicated boosters – e.g., a Damnation in an armor fleet or a Vulture in a shield fleet – and are designed to survive. Their type of boosts align with the fleet’s tank: armor fleets typically get armor resistance boosts, shield fleets get shield boosts, and fast kiting fleets get skirmish boosts for speed. These ships usually sit at the heart of the fleet formation.)
Heavy Assault Cruisers (T2 Combat Cruisers for DPS)
Heavy Assault Cruisers (HACs) are Tech II cruisers that trade some speed for superior damage, resilience, and range. They feature in many modern fleet doctrines for their combination of smaller signature and high damage projection:
Muninn (Type ID: 12015) – Minmatar HAC, popular in nullsec for artillery fit. The Muninn has bonuses to projectile weapon damage and optimal range, making it ideal for 720mm artillery cannons. Muninn-focused fleets became a dominant doctrine in recent years, using high-speed shield-tanked Muninns to snipe enemies at 70–100km with high alpha strikes. This doctrine’s popularity was due to the ship’s compact size and heavy volley damage (the epitome of nullsec HAC fleets at one point).
Eagle (Type ID: 12011) – Caldari HAC oriented around railguns. The Eagle’s optimal range bonus to hybrid turrets allows it to hit very far with Spike ammo. Eagle fleets have served as long-range shield sniper gangs, dealing kinetic/thermal damage with excellent tracking. They were notably used in large null battles for their ability to whittle down targets from extreme distances while surviving by virtue of their range and decent shield tank
adam4eve.eu
.
Cerberus (Type ID: 11993, approx) – Caldari HAC that excels with heavy missiles. Cerberus fleets (shield-tanked) fire salvos of long-range heavy missiles, striking enemies from beyond 100km. The Cerb’s range and kinetic damage bonuses make it a fearsome long-range missile boat. It has seen use particularly when meta shifts favor missiles – for instance, some alliances ran Cerberus doctrines to counter turret-based fleets, leveraging their range and precision.
Zealot (Type ID: 12003) – Amarr HAC specialized in lasers. The Zealot has a bonus to optimal range for energy turrets, enabling focused medium beam lasers or pulse lasers to project well. Historically, Zealot armor fleets (often with pulse lasers) were common for fast-moving armor HAC gangs, dealing high EM/Thermal damage at range. A classic use was the “Armor HAC” doctrine of years past where Zealots would kite and hammer targets from a distance (especially effective in the era after AoE doomsdays were removed, giving HACs a clear role).
Ishtar (Type ID: 12005) – Gallente HAC, notorious for its drone damage output. The Ishtar’s prominence peaked in the infamous “Ishtar swarm” meta, where fleets of Ishtars with sentry drones (e.g., Curator II’s) could output immense collective damage at range. This HAC can also use heavy attack drones for closer brawls. Even after drone assist mechanics were nerfed, Ishtars remain a powerful PvP platform in fleets, providing flexible damage types and the ability to hit from long range using sentries. Their strong combination of speed (when nano-fit) and drone DPS kept them relevant in hit-and-run fleet comps.
Vagabond (Type ID: 11999) – Minmatar HAC emphasizing speed and close-range autocannon damage. The Vagabond is one of the fastest HACs, traditionally used for rapid “skirmish” roles. In larger fleet contexts, Vagabonds occasionally appear as heavy tackle or rapid-response wings that chase down stragglers. Their damage is respectable (especially against softer targets) but in large-scale doctrines they were largely supplanted by Muninns which offered better ranged damage. Still, the Vagabond’s hit-and-run capability makes it a favorite in fast cruiser gangs.
Sacrilege (Type ID: 12019) – Amarr HAC, an armor-tanked missile brawler. The Sacrilege trades lasers for kinetic/thermal missiles (HAMs usually) and boasts a strong armor tank. While not commonly the primary ship-of-the-line in huge fleets, Sacrileges sometimes feature in armor assault gangs, valued for their ability to brawl at close range with high resilience (and their missiles apply well even under heavy EW or kiting conditions). They also have utility high slots often used for neuting in close fights.
Deimos (Type ID: 12023) – Gallente HAC built for blaster combat. The Deimos delivers brutal close-range DPS (blaster and drone combined) but has to get close to do so, which is risky in large fleets. It’s more commonly seen in smaller gangs or specific roles (e.g., a Deimos squad to bust anchored heavy ships). In fleet fights, a few Deimoses could act as high-damage tackle hunters – once they grab something, they melt it – but their lack of range and relative fragility limit their widespread fleet use.
(Overall, HACs provide high damage in a smaller, harder-to-hit package than battleships. Modern nullsec warfare often favors HAC doctrines for their speed and survivability against capital-class weapons. For example, the Muninn and Eagle have been mainstays due to their ability to output significant volley damage while mitigating damage via range or sig/speed. HACs also can use the Assault Damage Control for brief survivability spikes, which is valuable when bombed or primaried.)
Strategic Cruisers (Tech III Cruisers)
Strategic Cruisers (T3 cruisers) are customizable vessels known for flexibility. Though nerfs have reduced their presence, they still appear in specialized fleet roles:
Tengu (Caldari T3 Cruiser) – The Tengu can be configured as a long-range missile platform with strong shield tank. Historically, Tengu fleets were formidable: heavy missile Tengus could project damage at very long ranges with high precision and speed. Nullsec alliances sometimes fielded 100mn AB Tengus as a doctrine, leveraging their survivability and range. Today, Tengus are less common in mainline roles but may be used for niche purposes like ECM subsystems or covert scouting. Their legacy remains as a once-dominant fleet comp for ranged kiting DPS.
Loki (Minmatar T3 Cruiser) – The Loki is prized for its versatility; in fleets it often takes on support roles. A common use is the webbing Loki: fit with range-bonused stasis webifier subsystems, a Loki can slow enemies from afar (much like a Huginn). Loki fleets have also been fielded as skirmish doctrines, as the ship can be fit for good projectile DPS with decent armor or shield tank. Notably, after changes to command boosts, Lokis became popular as durable command burst platforms or as heavy tackle that’s more survivable than an HAC. In large fights, one might see Lokis intermingled to web or target-paint hostile fast movers.
Legion (Amarr T3 Cruiser) – The Legion finds use in armor fleets, sometimes as a heavy armor ECM/neutralizer platform. It can fit warfare boosts and was once a common off-grid booster. On-grid, Legions can fit beam lasers or heavy assault missiles; however, in large fleet meta they’re usually brought for specialty fits (such as a cloaky probing Legion, or a Legion with the interdiction nullifier to escort fleets through bubbles). One notable fleet role: neut Legions, which can fit extended range energy neutralizers to assist in draining enemy capitals or strategic targets while remaining more nimble than battleships.
Proteus (Gallente T3 Cruiser) – A Gallente strategic cruiser that was historically known for its covert ops fits (used by cloaky Proteus gangs in wormhole space) and heavy tackle role. In open nullsec fleets, Proteus ships were at one point used as brick-tanked brawlers (e.g., during the era of Drone Assist, some used Proteus with sentry drones). They can be very tanky with armor and were sometimes the linchpin of low-signature armor blobs. However, their lack of range and slower speed hampered widespread use. Today a Proteus might appear as a command burst platform or heavy tackle that jumps in to pin targets with a covert cyno – specialized tasks rather than line combat.
(Strategic Cruisers shine in adaptive roles. They can swap subsystems for different bonuses, so an alliance might use a few strategic cruisers configured for probing, ECM, links, or other tasks within an otherwise homogeneous fleet. With their increased survivability and utility, T3 cruisers fill gaps: for example, one might see a nullsec fleet include a “nullified” Tengu or Loki to chase retreating enemies through bubbles, or a boosting Loki providing skirmish boosts alongside HACs.)
Logistics Ships (Repair Vessels)
Logistics ships are dedicated healing vessels that keep the fleet alive via remote repairs. In any large fleet, roughly 20% of ships are logistics. There are tech I and tech II variants:
Guardian (Type ID: ~11987) – Amarr T2 Logistics Cruiser, armor repair specialist. The Guardian carries bonuses to remote armor repair amount and capacitor use, and famously uses the cap-chain system (pairing up Guardians to transfer capacitor). It is the workhorse of armor fleets: a wing of Guardians will orbit behind the main fleet, projecting armor reps to keep battleships and HACs alive. Generally, the Guardian (and its T1 counterpart Augoror) form the backbone of armor logistics in nullsec. Its reliable cap-chain and strong reps make it invaluable in any armor doctrine.
Basilisk (Type ID: ~11985) – Caldari T2 Logistics Cruiser, shield transfer specialist. Like the Guardian, the Basilisk uses a cap-chain (Caldari logi typically pair in sets) and provides remote shield boosts. In shield fleets, Basilisks are considered core fleet logistics, keeping Feroxes, Ravens, or any shield-tanked ships sustained under fire. Basilisks have superior raw repping throughput (and can fit four Large Shield Transporters easily), which is why heavy shield battleship fleets lean on them for logi superiority. However, they require teamwork (cap transfers) to function at full capacity.
Scimitar (Type ID: ~11989) – Minmatar T2 Logistics Cruiser, fast shield logistics. Unlike the Basilisk, the Scimitar is cap-stable solo (no chain needed) and is much faster and more agile. It gives slightly less raw rep but excels in high-mobility doctrines (e.g., Nanite shields, HAC fleets) where speed is life. Scimitars often accompany faster shield fleets such as Muninns or nano-Cerb gangs, where their ability to keep up and react quickly is more important than sheer rep power. They also typically fit one or two tracking links to assist friendly ships’ targeting.
Oneiros (Type ID: ~11991) – Gallente T2 Logistics Cruiser, armor repair (cap-chainless). The Oneiros provides armor reps without needing to pair for cap transfer. It has a larger base capacitor and four high slots for remote reps. Oneiros are often used in smaller armor gangs or in situations where a cap chain is inconvenient (e.g., when spread out or under heavy neut pressure). In large fleets, Oneiroses can supplement Guardians, especially in skirmishing armor HAC fleets where their mobility (being faster than Guardians) helps. However, they have a shorter effective range on reps compared to Guardians, so they typically operate closer to the fight.
Tech I Logistics Cruisers – These are the cheaper, easier-to-train variants: Augoror (Amarr, armor), Exequror (Gallente, armor), Osprey (Caldari, shield), and Scythe (Minmatar, shield). Despite being tech I, they are extremely effective for their cost and many alliances have used them in mass. In fact, several published fleet compositions use T1 logistic cruisers as their backbone. For example, an Osprey/Scythe-based shield fleet can sustain significant damage in a fight at a fraction of the cost of Basilisks. These ships use cap chains as well (Augoror/Osprey do), and while they have fewer bonuses, a large number of them can keep a fleet alive (“mass Ospreys” were a thing in certain coalitions for budget fleets). They are common in newbie organizations and militias where getting everyone into a T2 logi isn’t feasible.
Force Auxiliary (FAX) – (Not a cruiser, but worth mentioning in context) In super-large-scale battles, Capital Logistics (Force Auxiliaries like the Apostle or Minokawa) might be present providing massive reps. However, those typically appear only when capital fleets clash. For subcapital fights, the above cruisers remain the staple.
(A well-balanced fleet ensures it has enough “Logi”. Typically, armor fleets field Guardians (with some Oneiros support) and shield fleets field Basilisks (with some Scimitars), as reflected in the adage: “Generally speaking, the T2 Guardian and Basilisk are the fleet logistic ships… Scimitar and Oneiros are skirmish or small gang logistics”. Without these healers, large fleets cannot sustain losses against concentrated fire. Logistics pilots coordinate via separate comms and watchlists, responding instantly to broadcasted calls for repairs.)
Interdictors (T2 Destroyers for Area Denial)
Interdictors (“dictors”) are destroyer-class ships that can deploy Warp Disruption Probes – creating warp disruption bubbles in nullsec or wormhole space. They are indispensable in large fleet warfare for pinning down enemy fleets and stopping warp-outs
wiki.eveuniversity.org
:
Sabre (Type ID: 22456) – Minmatar Interdictor, by far the most commonly used dictor. The Sabre is favored for its high speed and agility combined with a decent shield tank. Its Tech II resists (Minmatar shield) and fast probe deployment make it the quintessential nullsec dictor – in fact, “when we say ‘dictor’, we often mean the Sabre”. In fleets, Sabres race ahead to drop bubbles on enemy fleets or to catch retreating targets. They are also effective against small ships, carrying light guns that can threaten pods or drones. The Sabre’s popularity is well-earned: it has long been a popular option among the four light interdictors due to its speed and survivability.
Flycatcher (Type ID: 22464) – Caldari Interdictor, known for a strong shield tank. The Flycatcher can fit an oversized shield buffer and has bonuses to light missiles. This makes it a bit slower than a Sabre but much harder to kill quickly. Fleet commanders will sometimes choose Flycatchers when they expect heavy resistance to their bubble ships – for instance, when flying into defensive smartbombs or heavy fire, a Flycatcher might survive where a Sabre would not. It is described as having a “sizeable tank” compared to other dictors, making it a viable option for shield fleets that need their bubble ship to live longer.
Eris (Type ID: 22460) – Gallente Interdictor, notable for the highest damage potential of the four. The Eris can fit bonused small hybrid turrets (blasters or rails) and uniquely, it has a bonus reducing the mass penalty of armor plates – meaning it can be armor-tanked without sacrificing too much agility. With an armor tank and blasters, an Eris can serve in armor fleets as a durable bubble-dropper that also contributes meaningful DPS (sometimes important in smaller fights). In large fleets, while less prevalent than Sabres, Erises have become more popular (“the new hotness”) after various balance passes that improved their speed and survivability. They are particularly useful if the FC wants an interdictor that can brawl and linger on grid, scramming or blasting tackled ships.
Heretic (Type ID: 22452) – Amarr Interdictor, an armor-tanked dictor with bonuses to rocket and light missile rate of fire. The Heretic is the slowest of the interdictors but also the most inherently resilient (thanks to an innate armor resist bonus). In armor fleets, Heretics are used to deploy bubbles in close quarters where their toughness lets them survive a bit longer under fire. They might be seen holding down a bubbled capital, for instance, where their lower speed is not an issue. The Heretic’s strong armor and resist bonuses make it a tougher armor-tanked option among dictors, albeit at the cost of speed. It’s often flown with an armor buffer and maybe a Afterburner for controlled movement in heavy bubbles.
All interdictors share the ability to launch Warp Disrupt Probes (20km radius spheres that prevent warp)
wiki.eveuniversity.org
, as well as Surgical Probes (smaller radius, longer duration) and even Webification Probes (“Wubble” – applies an AoE web). In practice, dictor pilots are some of the busiest in a fleet: they must fly ahead of enemies to drop bubbles at the right spot and time. A well-flown interdictor can secure dozens of kills for its fleet by trapping the enemy, whereas a misflown one can accidentally bubble its own fleet or miss the catch. It’s a high-skill, high-risk role (dictor pilots are often primaried and expected to die – “most will die regularly”), yet every nullsec alliance needs them and every fleet will have at least a couple. The Sabre’s dominance in this role has only recently been challenged by buffs to the Eris and Flycatcher, but all four see use depending on fleet doctrine (e.g., armor comp might favor Heretic/Eris, shield comp Sabre/Flycatcher).
Heavy Interdictors (Heavy Tackle Cruisers)
Heavy Interdiction Cruisers (HICs or “hictors”) are Tech II cruisers designed for heavy tackle: they can generate an unjammable warp disruption field or an infinite-strength point to pin down even supercapitals
wiki.eveuniversity.org
. They trade mobility and remote reps for this powerful capability. The empire HICs are:
Devoter (Type ID: 12017) – Amarr Heavy Interdictor. The Devoter is heavily armor-tanked (6 low slots for armor modules) and is known for its strong buffer tank. In fleets, a Devoter often serves as the immovable object that jumps in and activates its warp disruption field generator, creating a 20km bubble centered on itself. It can also fit a scripted infinite-point to tackle supercapitals. Amarr doctrine fleets (armor) will use Devoters as anchor HICs to hold down hostile supers or to screen the fleet, moving in concert with enemies to keep them bubbled. The Devoter “does what Amarr do best – tank” (having among the highest raw EHP of HICs) and is prized for not dying while its bubble is up.
Phobos (Type ID: 12021) – Gallente Heavy Interdictor. The Phobos is also armor-tanked, with a slot layout allowing a mix of armor and some flexibility. It’s somewhat faster than the Devoter but a bit less tanky. Fleets use Phoboi (plural) similarly as Devoters – to hold down targets with infinite-point script or bubble an area. A Phobos might be seen jumping through a gate first to trap an enemy fleet on the other side with its bubble. It has the highest on-paper DPS among HICs (due to hybrid turret bonuses), but in fleet use its damage is secondary to its tackle role. It’s a solid choice for armor fleets needing multiple hictors.
Onyx (Type ID: 11995) – Caldari Heavy Interdictor. The Onyx is unique for being a shield-tanked HIC. It has a thick shield buffer and bonuses to kinetic missiles, and thanks to shields it can sustain a bubble while remaining somewhat mobile. In shield fleets, an Onyx provides a durable heavy tackle that can join fast-moving ships (not as fast as smaller hulls, but faster than armor HICs). For example, a shield battleship fleet might bring an Onyx to infinipoint an enemy supercap or to bubble on a station. The Onyx’s strong tank (passive regen fits are common) and long-range disruption script range make it a valued heavy tackler. It and the Broadsword are also the only HICs naturally at home in shield doctrines.
Broadsword (Type ID: 12013) – Minmatar Heavy Interdictor. The Broadsword is a shield-tanked HIC with bonuses to shield resistances and projectile weapons. It is quite balanced: decent speed, good shield tank, and the ability to fit either artillery or autos (though damage is again not primary). Broadswords are often used in large fleets to catch fast or fleeing targets – for instance, to grab a nano-HAC gang with the extended infinite-point range scripts (HIC script range bonus 5% per level means a Broadsword can point out past disruptor range). In large fleet battles, Broadswords might anchor near the FC or key friendly ships, ready to bubble incoming hostile reinforcements or to shut down enemy MJDs (since a scripted HIC point also stops Micro Jump Drives). Their combination of speed and tank arguably makes them the most rounded HIC for general use.
All heavy interdictors can fit the Warp Disruption Field Generator which has two modes: unscripted, it creates a mobile warp bubble around the ship (radius 12–20km depending on skills); scripted, it becomes a focused infinite-strength point (or scram) that can even tackle supercapitals in lowsec (something no other ship can do). The tradeoff: while the field is active, HICs cannot receive remote reps and have increased signature – essentially painting a big bullseye on themselves. This means HIC pilots must manage their module carefully, often only activating it at the critical moment to catch a target, and deactivating if they need reps. They also often fit dual tanks (e.g., shield and armor or hull) to survive the “no remote rep” penalty as long as possible. In fleets, heavy dictors are the ones that hold the impossible catches – from wormhole rolling HICs (using bubbles to collapse wormholes with their mass) to nullsec battles where they pin down Titans trying to escape. Every major null battle involving supercapitals will have HICs on field to ensure those costly ships can’t simply warp off. (Note: Two rare faction HICs, the Sansha’s Nation Fiend and Mordu’s Legion Laelaps, exist from Alliance Tournaments. They are incredibly expensive and not used in normal fleet ops, hence are omitted here.)
Recon and Electronic Warfare Ships
Recon ships (Tech II cruisers in Combat Recon and Force Recon varieties) and specialized EWAR ships play support roles by crippling enemy ships’ movement, targeting, or other capabilities. In fleet compositions, these ships are fewer in number but high in impact:
Huginn (Minmatar Combat Recon) – The Huginn is renowned for its double bonus to Stasis Webifier range and Target Painter effectiveness. In virtually any large fleet, a few Huginns will be present to web enemy ships (especially fast tackle or nano-HACs) from long distance, drastically slowing them. By slowing targets, Huginns enable the main fleet (battleships or HACs) to apply damage more effectively. They also paint targets to increase their signature radius, improving hit quality for missiles and artillery. Huginns usually sit with or slightly ahead of friendly main ships, projecting multiple 60km+ webs. As a Combat Recon, they also don’t appear on directional scanners, which is occasionally useful in surprise deployments

. In summary, Huginns are critical for trap and kill: once a Huginn webs a speedy enemy, that target is as good as dead to the fleet’s guns.
Lachesis (Gallente Combat Recon) – The Lachesis provides long-range warp disruption and sensor dampening. It has a huge bonus to disruptor/scrambler range, meaning a Lachesis can pin down targets from 50–70km away (far beyond normal point range). In fleets, Lachesis are used to grab fast or fleeing ships that might otherwise escape the range of conventional tackle – for example, snagging Logistics or command ships in the back line. Additionally, Lachesis pilots often fit remote sensor dampeners to either reduce enemy lock range (thwarting their target calling or logistics) or increase their lock time. A common tactic is a Lachesis will point an enemy logistics cruiser at range and damp it, preventing it from locking anything to rep. This combination of tackle and EWAR makes them extremely valuable in nullsec fleet fights, essentially selectively silencing key enemy ships.
Rapier (Minmatar Force Recon) – The Rapier is the cloaking counterpart to the Huginn. It also has bonuses to web and painter range, though slightly lower webs than Huginn (as Force Recons have one fewer bonus). Rapiers typically fit Covert Ops cloaks, allowing them to sneak into position and ambush. In fleet warfare, Rapiers are often used for covert operations: lighting covert cynos for black ops drops or uncloaking to web important enemy ships (e.g., webbing an enemy FC’s ship or fast interceptor to enable others to catch it). While not as overtly present as Huginns, a couple of Rapiers per fleet can greatly extend a coalition’s electronic attack options (and they can bridge in bomber wings via covert cyno). Their painters also help increase damage application on small, hard-to-hit targets like interceptors or dreadnoughts under siege (yes, painters help capital missiles too).
Arazu (Gallente Force Recon) – The Arazu complements the Lachesis by adding a covert cloak. Arazus can lurk invisible and then surprise-tackle important enemy assets with long-range warp scramblers/disruptors. One classic use is an Arazu sneaking up to a fleeing enemy supercapital and putting infinite-point (from a fitted Focused Warp Scram script in a HIC, or regular point if it’s just an Arazu – actually Arazus can’t infinipoint) – rather, Arazu would tackle something so that HICs can arrive. In subcap fleets, Arazus might cloak and maneuver onto the flank or behind enemy logi, then decloak to dampen and tackle them, causing chaos in the enemy’s backline. The element of surprise and the psychological effect of cloaked threat make the Arazu a valuable tool even if pure Combat Recons (like Lachesis) have better raw stats. A Force Recon Arazu can also fit a covert cyno, bridging in bombers or BLOPs battleships directly on grid.
Curse (Amarr Combat Recon) – The Curse is an electronic warfare cruiser with bonuses to energy neutralizer/vampire range and tracking disruptors. In fleet context, Curses operate as medium-range “neutralizing batteries” – for instance, a Curse can drain the capacitor of hostile logistics or heavy tackle from 30–40km away, rendering them helpless. This is incredibly useful to break enemy logistics chains or shut off an active tanking battleship. Additionally, with tracking disruptors (bonus to effectiveness), a Curse can significantly hamper enemy turret ships’ ability to hit (either by reducing optimal range or tracking). A few Curses in an armor fleet might be assigned to permanently neut enemy Guardians or Basilisks, or to defensively TD enemy artillery battleships, mitigating damage. Being a Combat Recon, it also doesn’t appear on d-scan, which can mask its approach until it strikes. The Curse’s presence forces enemy FCs to consider capacitor warfare in their plan.
Pilgrim (Amarr Force Recon) – The Pilgrim is the cloaked variant of the Curse. It is an ambush predator: often flown with a heavy neut/nos fit, it will cloak and approach key targets (like a lone Marauder or enemy FC ship) and then decloak at close range, apply multiple powerful energy neuts and possibly a scrambler to disable MWD/cap boosters. In large fleets, Pilgrims can be used as sneaky wingmen that decloak amidst enemy logistics and instantly shut several down by draining their cap. While less used in stand-up fleet fights (because they must get very close, which is dangerous), their initial cloak approach can allow at least one volley of devastating neuting before the enemy reacts. They can also fit covert cynos for BLOPs operations like Rapiers/Arazus. Essentially, a Pilgrim brings surprise factor and extreme cap warfare in a compact package.
Falcon (Caldari Force Recon) – The Falcon is (in)famous for its ECM jamming capabilities with a covert cloak. Although ECM mechanics changed (now if you jam someone, they can’t target you but can still target others), Falcons are still used to break enemy target locks at critical moments. A Falcon in a fleet might decloak and jam all enemy logi or key ships at once for a short duration, buying time during the alpha strike or saving a friendly that was about to die. Falcons historically were a staple of null fleets to shut off enemy logistics – even post-nerf, a Falcon can make itself the sole target of whoever it jams (drawing fire away). The psychological impact of “being jammed” remains – jammed ships lose locks and have to reacquire targets. Falcons are often coordinated in wings to cycle jams on priority targets (e.g., enemy FC ship, enemy Force Aux, etc.). Their cloaking ability means they can lurk safely until needed or be used as scouts as well.
Rook (Caldari Combat Recon) – The Rook is a non-cloaky ECM platform that trades the Falcon’s stealth for slightly better tank and damage. In a fleet role, Rooks position at range and attempt to jam hostile ships continuously. Since Combat Recons don’t show on d-scan, a Rook can sometimes catch enemies by surprise when it lands on grid. In practice, since the ECM changes, Rooks are less commonly seen in large fleets – but if they appear, they act similarly to Falcons, focusing on breaking enemy support’s locks. They do have some self-defense with missiles, but their main role is still electronic attack.
Blackbird (Tech I Cruiser) – The Blackbird deserves a mention as the low-cost ECM platform. Many alliances new or old have fit up squads of cheap Blackbirds to jam enemy heavy hitters in fleets. For example, a dozen Blackbirds spreading jams on hostile battleships can greatly reduce incoming DPS for a time. They are extremely flimsy (T1 cruiser), often called “ECM Burst” because their life expectancy is short, but they are so cheap that trading a few Blackbird losses to neutralize enemy firepower is worth it. Historically, during the Casino War and other conflicts, entire “ECM wings” of Blackbirds or Griffins were fielded by the thousands. While not as prevalent now due to the same ECM changes, a well-timed Blackbird jam can still be clutch.
Other EWAR Frigates – In specialized fleets (especially NPSI or small support wings in big fights), you might see tiny ships like the Hyena (Minmatar T2 EWAR frigate with webs/paints) zipping around to help pin down fast targets, or the Keres (Gallente EWAR frigate with long warp disrupt and sensor damps) tagging pesky tackle. Even Tech I disruption frigs (Griffin for ECM, Crucifier for tracking disrupt, Vigil for target painting, Maulus for damps) might be used by newer pilots to contribute. They’re not “doctrine critical” in large fleets, but they can enhance the overall effectiveness by adding extra debuffs on enemies. For instance, in some large battles, newbie pilots in Vigils are asked to paint supercapitals to help torpedoes apply better, or Griffins try to jam out hostile target-callers briefly. These ships are the spice that an FC might add to a fleet comp if available.
In summary, Recon/EWAR ships are force multipliers – a handful can disrupt an enemy fleet’s cohesiveness and enable your fleet to hit harder and survive longer. Most standard doctrines include at least a few dedicated recon pilots (e.g., “webifiers” in Minmatar recons and “damp/point” in Gallente recons). Their correct use requires coordination (and often separate assignment by the FC), but when done right, a few recons can neutralize dozens of enemy ships without firing a single shot.
Interceptors and Fast Tackle
Fast tackle refers to the super-fast frigates that race ahead of the fleet to pin enemies down. Interceptors (T2 frigates) are the prime example, as they are virtually immune to bubbles (with Nullification) and extremely quick. In medium/large fleets, dedicated fast tackle pilots are crucial for catching enemy stragglers, holding skirmishers in place, and providing initial targets for the main fleet to warp onto.
Stiletto (Minmatar Interceptor) – A commonly used fleet interceptor, known for its speed and 4 mid slots perfect for tackle (warp disruptors/scrams and webs). Stilettos zoom around the battlespace, quickly locking and tackling targets with long point range. They are often the first ship an FC will send to grab a fleeing target. In nullsec, a group of Stilettos might fan out to catch as many enemy as possible when a fleet breaks. Their agility and speed also make them excellent scouts for warping the fleet to optimal positions (often a Stiletto will be the fleet’s warp-in, due to its speed getting it on top of the enemy).
Malediction (Amarr Interceptor) – A favored armor-tanked interceptor, the Malediction can fit a decent armor buffer and still hit high speeds. It’s used in armor fleets as a durable tackle that can survive a bit longer under defensive fire (or smartbombs) while holding an enemy down. Maledictions also have a bonus to rocket damage, so they can contribute a bit of DPS or kill enemy drones tackling their friendly ships. In fleet comps like armor battleship fleets, a few Maledictions streaking out to snag fast targets is standard.
Ares (Gallente Interceptor) – Ares is one of the fastest interceptors in straight-line speed. It has bonuses to warp scramble range and capacitors, making it reliable for long tackles. With 3 mid slots, it usually carries dual prop (MWD/AB) and a disruptor. Ares often serve as quick tackle and fleet warp-ins; an FC might call “Ares, get me tackle on that Bhaalgorn” and the Ares, being fast, is first to reach and hold point. It’s also common to see Ares used as a makeshift command relay (when fleets manually warp around grid, often the Ares’s position is used as a warp-to reference for the slower ships).
Crow (Caldari Interceptor) – The Crow is a combat-oriented interceptor with bonuses to missiles. It sacrifices a bit of speed compared to Stiletto/Ares, but in exchange it can apply some damage from range (light missiles). In some doctrines, Crows are used not just to tackle but to swarm enemy support (like enemy bombers or ewar) and kill them with missile volleys. Their ability to engage from 20–30km while speeding around makes them versatile skirmishers. For fleets, a Crow can both tackle and serve as a picket, chasing off enemy inty gangs or clearing drones.
Interceptors in general have the unique trait of bubble immunity (for the T2 combat interceptors), which means they can chase targets even through bubble fields and are ideal for rapid response. Fleet commanders typically assign interceptor pilots roles like “catch anyone trying to warp off” or “burn 150km ahead of the enemy and light a cyno/provide warp-in.” They also double as scouts due to their speed and nullification – interceptors will often be the ones jumping ahead of the fleet through gates to report enemy positions and to grab initial tackle until heavier ships arrive. In large fleet engagements, while the main firepower comes from battleships or HACs, those kills frequently would not happen without a couple of brave interceptors tackling targets. A fast tackle pilot has to balance aggression with survival – a dead interceptor tackles nothing – so they often orbit at extreme ranges, keep transversal high, and only go in for scram or web if absolutely needed. Still, interceptors are usually cheap and are often lost; their pilots are celebrated when they manage to “hero tackle” a crucial target (like holding down an enemy super long enough for reinforcements). (Aside from interceptors, some Tech I frigates and faction frigates serve as fast tackle in a pinch – e.g., the Caldari Navy Hookbill or Minmatar Slasher – but in medium/large fleets, the sheer speed and resilience (to bubbles) of interceptors make them the go-to. An honorable mention is the Claw (Minmatar combat interceptor) which was used in “wolfpack” doctrines to directly fight other small ships, but these specialized inty doctrines have seen reduced use after interceptors had their nullification briefly removed and then partially restored. Nonetheless, interceptors remain integral to fleet ops for their tactical utility.)
Command Destroyers (Micro Jump Field “Booshers”)
Command Destroyers (CMDDs) are a support class of destroyers that can micro jump themselves and nearby ships 100 km in any direction using a Micro Jump Field Generator (MJFG). This ability, commonly called “booshing,” has huge tactical applications in fleets. Command Destroyers also can fit a command burst to provide limited boosts, but their signature move is the MJFG. Common command destroyers include:
Pontifex (Amarr Command Destroyer) – An armor-tanked boosh ship often used in armor fleets. The Pontifex provides minor armor/shield bonuses (it has resist bonuses per Amarr destroyer skill) and can mount an armor command burst, but most importantly it can boosh. For example, in an armor battleship fleet vulnerable to bombing runs, a Pontifex might activate its MJFG to jump a cluster of friendly battleships 100km away the moment before bombs hit, saving them. Pontifexes are also used to jump enemy tackle or drones off the fleet, effectively “peeling” enemies away. They tend to fit buffer armor and are somewhat slower than their shield counterparts, but in armor doctrines they’re the saviors against bombers and can reposition entire squads of heavy ships in an instant.
Stork (Caldari Command Destroyer) – A shield-tanked command destroyer; common in shield fleets to counter bombs and herd the fleet. The Stork has bonuses to shield resist (per Caldari destroyer skill) and often carries a shield command burst to slightly increase fleet shields. In practice, Stork pilots in a shield fleet (like a Ferox or Muninn fleet) are on standby to boosh friendlies out of danger or boosh enemies apart. For instance, if hostile logistics get too close, a daring Stork might burn in and boosh, hoping to drag the enemy logi 100km off their DPS ships, isolating them. Coordination is key: only one boosh can affect a ship per server tick, so fleets typically coordinate so that multiple CMDDs don’t interfere with each other. Storks, being shield, synergize with the faster shield doctrines and often carry Defender missiles too (to shoot down incoming bombs).
Bifrost (Minmatar Command Destroyer) – The Bifrost is another shield command destroyer, similar in stats to the Stork but with Minmatar traits (skirmish burst bonus). Bifrosts are common in any fleet for their skirmish boost (e.g., giving a slight speed boost to all ships) and their booshing. They are often the preferred command dessie for nullsec alliances due to their flexibility – a Bifrost can provide a Skirmish Command Burst to increase everyone’s MWD speed or point range, very handy in fast fleets. Meanwhile, it stands ready to boosh either friend or foe. A classic use: a Bifrost quickly burns to an optimal position amid an enemy bomber group and booshes them, scattering the bombers and nullifying their bombing run (since it displaces them and also bombs won’t hit moving targets). Or, Bifrosts may boosh trapped hostile tackle into the middle of the allied fleet so they can be destroyed with ease. The possibilities are endless, making these “fleet teleporters” extremely valuable.
Magus (Gallente Command Destroyer) – The Magus is an armor command destroyer (Gallente, so has armor resist bonus) similar to the Pontifex but with Gallente flavor (often fits info or skirmish bursts). In armor HAC or mixed fleets, Maguses provide the same boosh utility. They might carry an Information Command Burst to boost sensor strength or damp resistance for the fleet, but more often they’ll use skirmish bursts like a Pontifex would (since armor fleets often also want some tackle range or speed boost). The Magus doesn’t stand out particularly except that some pilot preferences lean to its slightly different slot layout. Functionally, it’s an armor boosh boat – get in, move friendlies or hostiles around at will.
Draugur (Triglavian Command Destroyer) – A special mention: the Draugur is the Triglavian CMDD, obtained via Abyssal content. It has different bonuses (to disintegrator range and damage instead of resists) and can be quite pricey. It can boosh like the others but without a resist bonus it’s a bit squishier. While not commonly seen in large null fleets (due to cost and rarity), it sometimes appears in elite wormhole or lowsec groups that leverage its powerful damage (a scaled-up entropic disintegrator on a destroyer does significant sustained DPS). In a standard doctrine, however, one of the empire CMDDs usually suffices.
In large-scale warfare, Command Destroyers are so influential that entire tactics revolve around them. Collectively referred to as “booshers,” they can reposition up to 25 allied ships (or enemy ships, if you manage to center them in the 6km MJFG radius) by 100km. Fleet commanders use this for: avoiding bomb damage, moving battleships across a void to chase the enemy, breaking up enemy logistics “balls” by jumping either the logi or the DPS away, or extracting their own tackle that got too deep. However, booshers require careful timing and discipline – accidentally jumping the fleet at the wrong moment can be disastrous (there’s even a meme: “Don’t boosh the fleet unless told!” because a mistimed boosh might fling half your fleet out of range while the rest get slaughtered). Typically, multiple command destroyers will be assigned in a fleet (e.g., “Boosh Team Alpha/Beta”) and only act on FC’s command. When the FC calls “Boosh, boosh, boosh!” that’s the signal to save the fleet from an incoming bombing run by jumping them. Because only one boosh works per tick, they usually go one at a time. Another nuance: MJFG won’t move capital ships or structures, and it won’t move ships that are scrammed. So booshers themselves often fit ECM bursts or their own scramblers so they can break tackle on themselves or friendlies just in time to execute the jump. In summary, Command Destroyers act as the “battlefield repositioning” units. Their introduction changed fleet combat, giving skilled groups the ability to greatly mitigate bombers and to outmaneuver opponents by literally teleporting around. Most major nullsec alliances incorporate a few CMDDs in each fleet for the utility; and indeed many heroic plays (and blunders) in recent years have come from well (or poorly) executed booshes. They truly embody the idea of a force multiplier, allowing creative and unexpected movement on the grid that can confuse and split the enemy force.
