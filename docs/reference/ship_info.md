# EVE Online Fleet Ship Reference

Fleet doctrines in EVE Online often revolve around specific ship classes optimized for particular roles. Below is a detailed list of ships commonly fielded in medium to large-scale fleets, organized by category, along with their Type ID (from the Static Data Export) and typical fleet roles.

## Battleships (Mainline DPS and Support)

### Tech I Battleships

- **Megathron** (Type ID: 641) – Gallente battleship known for its hybrid turrets. Often fit with railguns for long-range "alpha" volleys or blasters for close-range brawling. The Megathron has historically been a backbone of nullsec fleets as a sniper battleship, delivering high DPS under armor doctrines.

- **Apocalypse** (Type ID: 642) – Amarr battleship and dedicated laser sniper. With excellent range bonuses, the Apocalypse is commonly used to engage at long distances (up to ~150km) in large fleet fights. In armor fleets, "Apoc" formations deal sustained beam laser damage from afar.

- **Tempest** (Type ID: 639) – Minmatar battleship known for versatility and speed. Often fit with artillery for long-range volleys, the Tempest has been used as a fleet sniper in various doctrines. Its high-alpha strike (especially the Tempest Fleet Issue) made it a staple in early nullsec alpha fleets.

- **Maelstrom** (Type ID: 24694) – Minmatar battleship with a strong shield tank and bonuses to large projectiles. Common in shield doctrines, the Maelstrom's 1400mm artillery provides massive alpha damage. It was notably used in "alpha fleets" where synchronized volleys could instantly destroy targets.

- **Rokh** (Type ID: 24688) – Caldari battleship specialized for railguns. The Rokh has very high engagement range and strong shield tank, making it ideal as a long-range fleet platform. Rokh fleets can project hybrid turret DPS at extreme ranges (often 200+ km) in large engagements.

- **Abaddon** (Type ID: 24692) – Amarr battleship with monstrous armor and laser bonuses. The Abaddon is a premier heavy armor brawler, trading mobility for sheer tank. It's popular in armor-heavy fleets as a frontline DPS ship that can soak damage. An Abaddon-based doctrine leverages its high resistance and laser damage in sustained battles.

- **Armageddon** (Type ID: 643) – Amarr battleship featuring bonuses to energy neutralizers. In fleets, the Armageddon is often used as a support battleship to drain enemy capital/Logistics capacitors. Its ability to neut at range, combined with drones, makes it a threat to enemy sustain. Commonly fielded in armor fleets as a "neut Geddon" platform.

- **Scorpion** (Type ID: 640) – Caldari battleship dedicated to electronic warfare (ECM). The Scorpion's jammers can shut down enemy targeting; it is the only tech-1 ECM battleship and has been used to disrupt hostile logistics in large fights. Scorpions serve as specialized support, sacrificing damage for the ability to jam multiple enemies.

- **Dominix** (Type ID: 645) – Gallente battleship with a vast drone bay and bonus to drone damage. The Dominix has seen use in drone-based fleet doctrines ("Domis"), where pilots assign sentry drones for synchronized volleys. It has also been fielded as a remote repair platform or heavy neut platform in some armor comps, leveraging its versatility with drones and utility highs.

- **Typhoon** (Type ID: 644) – Minmatar battleship known for missile and torpedo tactics. It's one of the faster battleships; Typhoons have been used in fleet roles as rapid damage dealers (e.g. cruise missile Typhoon fleets for long-range sustained DPS, or torpedo fits for burst damage). Its flexibility (damage type selection with missiles) makes it a strong choice in certain fleet metas.

### Pirate Faction Battleships

- **Machariel** (Type ID: 17738) – Angel Cartel battleship famed for its speed and damage. The Machariel's combination of battleship-class artillery and cruiser-like mobility made it the linchpin of many fast shield fleets. "Mach" fleets would use its high mobility to dictate range, delivering brutal volley damage with 800mm autocannons or artillery. This ship was a popular choice across multiple nullsec wars for hit-and-run tactics and quick repositioning.

- **Nightmare** (Type ID: 17736) – Sansha's Nation battleship with bonuses to lasers and shield tank. Often used in shield fleets, the Nightmare deals very high EM/Thermal damage with Tachyon beam lasers and boasts a strong capacitor. In fleets, Nightmares function as heavy shield brawlers or snipers (they were notably used in certain nullsec doctrines for their burst DPS and in Incursion PvE communities for efficient kills).

- **Bhaalgorn** (Type ID: 17920) – Blood Raiders battleship specialized in energy neutralization and stasis webs. A Bhaalgorn in a fleet provides heavy support tackle: its overwhelming neutralizer strength can cap out enemy logistics or capital ships, and its long-range webs pin down targets. They appear in armor battleship fleets especially when facing capital threats, to drain and slow enemy supercapitals.

### Triglavian Battleships

- **Leshak** (Type ID: 47966) – Triglavian battleship armed with an Entropic Disintegrator. The Leshak's weapon ramps up in damage over time, making it uniquely powerful in protracted fights. Leshak fleets (and allied remote rep "Spider tank" tactics) have been seen in certain conflicts and PvE Invasions, where their sustained DPS becomes devastating. They also bring utility with heavy remote armor repairs and neuting capability. In large fleet battles, a wing of Leshaks can melt targets sequentially once their weapons spool to full damage.

*Note: Many other battleships see use, but the above are among the most common. Faction variants like the Navy Issue Megathron or Apocalypse Navy Issue are occasionally used for improved performance, while tech II Marauders are rarely fielded in large fleets due to cost and vulnerability when sieged.*

## Battlecruisers (Medium DPS platforms)

- **Ferox** (Type ID: 20648) – Caldari battlecruiser with bonuses to hybrid turrets (railguns). The Ferox is a staple of many nullsec alliances' doctrines, valued for its low cost and optimal range. A railgun Ferox fleet can project damage at 50–100km with decent tank, making it ideal for medium-sized fleet engagements. This reliable "line" ship frequently forms the backbone of newbie-friendly shield fleets.

- **Drake** (Type ID: 24698) – Caldari battlecruiser known for its durability and missile firepower. The Drake's thick shield tank and bonuses to heavy missiles spawned the infamous "Drake spam" era, where massive fleets of Drakes would saturate the field with missiles. In modern fleets, Drakes (or their Navy Issue variants) still serve as effective shield-tanked missile platforms that are easy to fly, providing sustained DPS with good range.

- **Hurricane** (Type ID: 24702) – Minmatar battlecruiser, versatile with projectile weapons. Historically a workhorse of PvP, the Hurricane can fit artillery for long-range volleys or autocannons for mid-range brawling. Shield-tanked artillery Hurricanes were once common for hit-and-run tactics, and armor-tanked Hurricanes occasionally feature in armor brawler fleets. It remains a solid all-rounder for medium-scale engagements.

- **Harbinger** (Type ID: 24696) – Amarr battlecruiser that fields lasers and armor tank. Harbingers see use in armor battlecruiser doctrines where their heavy pulse laser damage (bonus to optimal range) can be applied in mid-to-long range fights. While less ubiquitous than some counterparts, Harbingers offer strong DPS and a sturdy buffer, making them useful in armor brawling fleets or mixed-composition gangs.

- **Myrmidon** (Type ID: 24700) – Gallente battlecruiser with a versatile drone bay and armor repair bonuses. In fleets the Myrmidon is less common, but when used it can act as a drone-based damage platform or even a pseudo-logi (with local reps). Some armor doctrines leverage Myrmidons for their hefty drone damage plus utility (e.g., carrying remote repair drones), though their primary role remains in smaller gang or as tackle bait in larger fights.

### Attack Battlecruisers

- **Oracle** (Type ID: 4302) – Amarr attack battlecruiser designed to wield battleship-sized lasers. Oracles are utilized for long-range beam laser sniping or short-range pulse laser burst damage. In large fleet tactics, Oracle fleets (with beams) can alpha strike targets at extreme ranges like a glass cannon. Their high damage and range, offset by weak defenses, made them popular in the past for hit-and-fade volleys.

- **Naga** (Type ID: 4306) – Caldari attack battlecruiser that can fit battleship-sized railguns or torpedo launchers. In fleet use, Nagas typically serve as long-range rail platforms (akin to mini-Rokhs) delivering solid kinetic/thermal volleys at range. Some groups field torpedo Nagas for burst damage against capitals at closer ranges. Like all attack BCs, they are fragile but pack a punch.

- **Talos** (Type ID: 4304) – Gallente attack battlecruiser focusing on blasters (or rails). A Talos in fleet context is usually fit with blasters to obliterate targets that come within medium range, acting as a high-DPS glass cannon. They are less commonly massed in null fleets (due to limited range), but might appear in fast-moving gangs where their overwhelming close-range DPS can delete targets that have been tackled.

- **Tornado** (Type ID: 4308) – Minmatar attack battlecruiser built for large artillery cannons. Tornados excel at alpha strike tactics: a group of artillery Tornados can one-volley fragile targets (like support cruisers or tackle) from long distance, then reposition. They have been widely used for hit-and-run and "ski sniper" roles, and occasionally as part of hit-and-run doctrines in nullsec due to their 1400mm guns' massive volley damage.

*Note: Tech II Command Ships are covered separately below. Standard Tech I battlecruisers like the Cyclone, Brutix, and Prophecy are less common in large fleets, but may appear in faction warfare or as budget doctrine substitutes.*

## Command Ships (Fleet Boosters – Tech II Battlecruisers)

Command ships are T2 battlecruisers that provide command boosts (warfare links) to enhance the fleet, while often still packing decent combat ability. They are commonly used as on-grid boosters in medium/large fleets:

- **Damnation** (Type ID: 22474) – Amarr Command Ship known for a colossal armor tank and armor warfare links. The Damnation is a premier fleet booster for armor fleets, thanks to its 3 warfare link capacity and extreme resilience. Fleet commanders often choose Damnations as command platforms to anchor the fleet, since they can survive heavy fire while projecting armor bonuses.

- **Vulture** (Type ID: 22472) – Caldari Command Ship focusing on shield warfare links. With strong shield resist bonuses, the Vulture serves as the go-to shield fleet booster, improving the shield durability of the fleet. It also fields hybrid turrets with range bonuses, so a Vulture can contribute railgun fire. In large shield fleets (e.g., those centered on Feroxes or Rokhs), one or more Vultures usually sit at the center providing maximum shield resistance boosts to allies.

- **Claymore** (Type ID: 22468) – Minmatar Command Ship oriented toward skirmish warfare bonuses (speed, agility, point range). Claymores are common in fast shield doctrines or nano-gang comp support, where their skirmish command bursts greatly enhance fleet mobility. A Claymore can significantly increase afterburner/MWD performance and tackle range for the fleet, often accompanying swift fleets like Muninns or nano-HACs.

- **Sleipnir** (Type ID: 22466) – Minmatar Command Ship with bonuses to skirmish links and projectile weapons. Unlike the Claymore, the Sleipnir is a more combat-oriented command ship (essentially a beefed-up Hurricane), so it often serves dual duty as a high-DPS autocannon platform and as a booster. In some medium-scale shield fleets, Sleipnirs might form the main line, bringing both strong damage and commanding friendly ships' speed/tackle enhancements.

- **Nighthawk** (Type ID: 22470) – Caldari Command Ship focusing on shield boosts and heavy missiles. The Nighthawk is occasionally used in missile doctrines as a hard-hitting platform that can simultaneously boost shields. Its damage application and range (with heavy missiles) make it effective in smaller fleet actions, though in large fleets it's more often overshadowed by the pure boosting role of the Vulture.

- **Eos** (Type ID: 22472) – Gallente Command Ship oriented to information warfare links (sensor strength, electronic warfare resistance) and drones. The Eos can boost sensor strength (to protect against ECM) or other EWAR-related aspects, which is more niche in fleet fights. However, it boasts a hefty drone bay and armor tank, so an Eos can add considerable drone DPS in armor fleets. It's sometimes fielded to provide sensor integrity boosts against jamming or to act as a battlefield drone combat/boost hybrid.

- **Absolution** (Type ID: 22476) – Amarr Command Ship with bonuses to armor links and lasers. Essentially a tougher Harbinger, the Absolution is a high-damage armor command ship. It can be used to boost armor (though the Damnation usually handles that in fleets) while adding significant laser DPS. Some armor doctrines favor Absolutions as frontline brawlers when raw damage is needed in addition to command boosts.

- **Astarte** (Type ID: 22466) – Gallente Command Ship with bonuses to skirmish/armor links and blasters. The Astarte is a brutal close-range brawler that can lead an armor or hybrid doctrine from the front. In practice it's less seen in modern null fleets, but when fielded, an Astarte provides command bonuses and heavy blaster firepower to punch through targets at close range.

*In summary, command ships are often present as dedicated boosters – e.g., a Damnation in an armor fleet or a Vulture in a shield fleet – and are designed to survive. Their type of boosts align with the fleet's tank: armor fleets typically get armor resistance boosts, shield fleets get shield boosts, and fast kiting fleets get skirmish boosts for speed. These ships usually sit at the heart of the fleet formation.*

## Heavy Assault Cruisers (T2 Combat Cruisers for DPS)

Heavy Assault Cruisers (HACs) are Tech II cruisers that trade some speed for superior damage, resilience, and range. They feature in many modern fleet doctrines for their combination of smaller signature and high damage projection:

- **Muninn** (Type ID: 12015) – Minmatar HAC, popular in nullsec for artillery fit. The Muninn has bonuses to projectile weapon damage and optimal range, making it ideal for 720mm artillery cannons. Muninn-focused fleets became a dominant doctrine in recent years, using high-speed shield-tanked Muninns to snipe enemies at 70–100km with high alpha strikes. This doctrine's popularity was due to the ship's compact size and heavy volley damage.

- **Eagle** (Type ID: 12011) – Caldari HAC oriented around railguns. The Eagle's optimal range bonus to hybrid turrets allows it to hit very far with Spike ammo. Eagle fleets have served as long-range shield sniper gangs, dealing kinetic/thermal damage with excellent tracking. They were notably used in large null battles for their ability to whittle down targets from extreme distances while surviving by virtue of their range and decent shield tank.

- **Cerberus** (Type ID: 11993) – Caldari HAC that excels with heavy missiles. Cerberus fleets (shield-tanked) fire salvos of long-range heavy missiles, striking enemies from beyond 100km. The Cerb's range and kinetic damage bonuses make it a fearsome long-range missile boat. It has seen use particularly when meta shifts favor missiles – for instance, some alliances ran Cerberus doctrines to counter turret-based fleets, leveraging their range and precision.

- **Zealot** (Type ID: 12003) – Amarr HAC specialized in lasers. The Zealot has a bonus to optimal range for energy turrets, enabling focused medium beam lasers or pulse lasers to project well. Historically, Zealot armor fleets (often with pulse lasers) were common for fast-moving armor HAC gangs, dealing high EM/Thermal damage at range. A classic use was the "Armor HAC" doctrine where Zealots would kite and hammer targets from a distance.

- **Ishtar** (Type ID: 12005) – Gallente HAC, notorious for its drone damage output. The Ishtar's prominence peaked in the infamous "Ishtar swarm" meta, where fleets of Ishtars with sentry drones (e.g., Curator II's) could output immense collective damage at range. This HAC can also use heavy attack drones for closer brawls. Even after drone assist mechanics were nerfed, Ishtars remain a powerful PvP platform in fleets, providing flexible damage types and the ability to hit from long range using sentries.

- **Vagabond** (Type ID: 11999) – Minmatar HAC emphasizing speed and close-range autocannon damage. The Vagabond is one of the fastest HACs, traditionally used for rapid "skirmish" roles. In larger fleet contexts, Vagabonds occasionally appear as heavy tackle or rapid-response wings that chase down stragglers. Their damage is respectable (especially against softer targets) but in large-scale doctrines they were largely supplanted by Muninns which offered better ranged damage.

- **Sacrilege** (Type ID: 12019) – Amarr HAC, an armor-tanked missile brawler. The Sacrilege trades lasers for kinetic/thermal missiles (HAMs usually) and boasts a strong armor tank. While not commonly the primary ship-of-the-line in huge fleets, Sacrileges sometimes feature in armor assault gangs, valued for their ability to brawl at close range with high resilience.

- **Deimos** (Type ID: 12023) – Gallente HAC built for blaster combat. The Deimos delivers brutal close-range DPS (blaster and drone combined) but has to get close to do so, which is risky in large fleets. It's more commonly seen in smaller gangs or specific roles (e.g., a Deimos squad to bust anchored heavy ships).

*Overall, HACs provide high damage in a smaller, harder-to-hit package than battleships. Modern nullsec warfare often favors HAC doctrines for their speed and survivability against capital-class weapons. For example, the Muninn and Eagle have been mainstays due to their ability to output significant volley damage while mitigating damage via range or sig/speed.*

## Strategic Cruisers (Tech III Cruisers)

Strategic Cruisers (T3 cruisers) are customizable vessels known for flexibility. Though nerfs have reduced their presence, they still appear in specialized fleet roles:

- **Tengu** (Caldari T3 Cruiser) – The Tengu can be configured as a long-range missile platform with strong shield tank. Historically, Tengu fleets were formidable: heavy missile Tengus could project damage at very long ranges with high precision and speed. Nullsec alliances sometimes fielded 100mn AB Tengus as a doctrine, leveraging their survivability and range. Today, Tengus are less common in mainline roles but may be used for niche purposes like ECM subsystems or covert scouting.

- **Loki** (Minmatar T3 Cruiser) – The Loki is prized for its versatility; in fleets it often takes on support roles. A common use is the webbing Loki: fit with range-bonused stasis webifier subsystems, a Loki can slow enemies from afar (much like a Huginn). Loki fleets have also been fielded as skirmish doctrines, as the ship can be fit for good projectile DPS with decent armor or shield tank. After changes to command boosts, Lokis became popular as durable command burst platforms or as heavy tackle that's more survivable than an HAC.

- **Legion** (Amarr T3 Cruiser) – The Legion finds use in armor fleets, sometimes as a heavy armor ECM/neutralizer platform. It can fit warfare boosts and was once a common off-grid booster. On-grid, Legions can fit beam lasers or heavy assault missiles; however, in large fleet meta they're usually brought for specialty fits (such as a cloaky probing Legion, or a Legion with the interdiction nullifier to escort fleets through bubbles).

- **Proteus** (Gallente T3 Cruiser) – A Gallente strategic cruiser that was historically known for its covert ops fits (used by cloaky Proteus gangs in wormhole space) and heavy tackle role. In open nullsec fleets, Proteus ships were at one point used as brick-tanked brawlers. They can be very tanky with armor and were sometimes the linchpin of low-signature armor blobs. Today a Proteus might appear as a command burst platform or heavy tackle that jumps in to pin targets with a covert cyno.

*Strategic Cruisers shine in adaptive roles. They can swap subsystems for different bonuses, so an alliance might use a few strategic cruisers configured for probing, ECM, links, or other tasks within an otherwise homogeneous fleet.*

## Logistics Ships (Repair Vessels)

Logistics ships are dedicated healing vessels that keep the fleet alive via remote repairs. In any large fleet, roughly 20% of ships are logistics. There are tech I and tech II variants:

### Tech II Logistics Cruisers

- **Guardian** (Type ID: 11987) – Amarr T2 Logistics Cruiser, armor repair specialist. The Guardian carries bonuses to remote armor repair amount and capacitor use, and famously uses the cap-chain system (pairing up Guardians to transfer capacitor). It is the workhorse of armor fleets: a wing of Guardians will orbit behind the main fleet, projecting armor reps to keep battleships and HACs alive. Its reliable cap-chain and strong reps make it invaluable in any armor doctrine.

- **Basilisk** (Type ID: 11985) – Caldari T2 Logistics Cruiser, shield transfer specialist. Like the Guardian, the Basilisk uses a cap-chain and provides remote shield boosts. In shield fleets, Basilisks are considered core fleet logistics, keeping Feroxes, Ravens, or any shield-tanked ships sustained under fire. Basilisks have superior raw repping throughput and can fit four Large Shield Transporters easily.

- **Scimitar** (Type ID: 11989) – Minmatar T2 Logistics Cruiser, fast shield logistics. Unlike the Basilisk, the Scimitar is cap-stable solo (no chain needed) and is much faster and more agile. It gives slightly less raw rep but excels in high-mobility doctrines (e.g., Nanite shields, HAC fleets) where speed is life. Scimitars often accompany faster shield fleets such as Muninns or nano-Cerb gangs.

- **Oneiros** (Type ID: 11991) – Gallente T2 Logistics Cruiser, armor repair (cap-chainless). The Oneiros provides armor reps without needing to pair for cap transfer. It has a larger base capacitor and four high slots for remote reps. Oneiros are often used in smaller armor gangs or in situations where a cap chain is inconvenient.

### Tech I Logistics Cruisers

These are the cheaper, easier-to-train variants: **Augoror** (Amarr, armor), **Exequror** (Gallente, armor), **Osprey** (Caldari, shield), and **Scythe** (Minmatar, shield). Despite being tech I, they are extremely effective for their cost and many alliances have used them in mass. These ships use cap chains as well, and while they have fewer bonuses, a large number of them can keep a fleet alive.

*A well-balanced fleet ensures it has enough "Logi". Typically, armor fleets field Guardians (with some Oneiros support) and shield fleets field Basilisks (with some Scimitars). Without these healers, large fleets cannot sustain losses against concentrated fire.*

## Interdictors (T2 Destroyers for Area Denial)

Interdictors ("dictors") are destroyer-class ships that can deploy Warp Disruption Probes – creating warp disruption bubbles in nullsec or wormhole space. They are indispensable in large fleet warfare for pinning down enemy fleets and stopping warp-outs:

- **Sabre** (Type ID: 22456) – Minmatar Interdictor, by far the most commonly used dictor. The Sabre is favored for its high speed and agility combined with a decent shield tank. Its Tech II resists and fast probe deployment make it the quintessential nullsec dictor. In fleets, Sabres race ahead to drop bubbles on enemy fleets or to catch retreating targets.

- **Flycatcher** (Type ID: 22464) – Caldari Interdictor, known for a strong shield tank. The Flycatcher can fit an oversized shield buffer and has bonuses to light missiles. This makes it a bit slower than a Sabre but much harder to kill quickly. Fleet commanders will sometimes choose Flycatchers when they expect heavy resistance to their bubble ships.

- **Eris** (Type ID: 22460) – Gallente Interdictor, notable for the highest damage potential of the four. The Eris can fit bonused small hybrid turrets (blasters or rails) and uniquely, it has a bonus reducing the mass penalty of armor plates – meaning it can be armor-tanked without sacrificing too much agility. In large fleets, Erises have become more popular after various balance passes that improved their speed and survivability.

- **Heretic** (Type ID: 22452) – Amarr Interdictor, an armor-tanked dictor with bonuses to rocket and light missile rate of fire. The Heretic is the slowest of the interdictors but also the most inherently resilient (thanks to an innate armor resist bonus). In armor fleets, Heretics are used to deploy bubbles in close quarters where their toughness lets them survive a bit longer under fire.

*All interdictors share the ability to launch Warp Disrupt Probes (20km radius spheres that prevent warp), as well as Surgical Probes (smaller radius, longer duration) and even Webification Probes ("Wubble" – applies an AoE web). Dictor pilots are some of the busiest in a fleet: they must fly ahead of enemies to drop bubbles at the right spot and time.*

## Heavy Interdictors (Heavy Tackle Cruisers)

Heavy Interdiction Cruisers (HICs or "hictors") are Tech II cruisers designed for heavy tackle: they can generate an unjammable warp disruption field or an infinite-strength point to pin down even supercapitals:

- **Devoter** (Type ID: 12017) – Amarr Heavy Interdictor. The Devoter is heavily armor-tanked (6 low slots for armor modules) and is known for its strong buffer tank. In fleets, a Devoter often serves as the immovable object that jumps in and activates its warp disruption field generator, creating a 20km bubble centered on itself. It can also fit a scripted infinite-point to tackle supercapitals.

- **Phobos** (Type ID: 12021) – Gallente Heavy Interdictor. The Phobos is also armor-tanked, with a slot layout allowing a mix of armor and some flexibility. It's somewhat faster than the Devoter but a bit less tanky. Fleets use Phoboi similarly as Devoters – to hold down targets with infinite-point script or bubble an area.

- **Onyx** (Type ID: 11995) – Caldari Heavy Interdictor. The Onyx is unique for being a shield-tanked HIC. It has a thick shield buffer and bonuses to kinetic missiles, and thanks to shields it can sustain a bubble while remaining somewhat mobile. In shield fleets, an Onyx provides a durable heavy tackle that can join fast-moving ships.

- **Broadsword** (Type ID: 12013) – Minmatar Heavy Interdictor. The Broadsword is a shield-tanked HIC with bonuses to shield resistances and projectile weapons. It is quite balanced: decent speed, good shield tank, and the ability to fit either artillery or autos. Broadswords are often used in large fleets to catch fast or fleeting targets.

*All heavy interdictors can fit the Warp Disruption Field Generator which has two modes: unscripted, it creates a mobile warp bubble around the ship; scripted, it becomes a focused infinite-strength point that can even tackle supercapitals. The tradeoff: while the field is active, HICs cannot receive remote reps and have increased signature.*

## Recon and Electronic Warfare Ships

Recon ships (Tech II cruisers in Combat Recon and Force Recon varieties) and specialized EWAR ships play support roles by crippling enemy ships' movement, targeting, or other capabilities:

### Combat Recons

- **Huginn** (Minmatar Combat Recon) – The Huginn is renowned for its double bonus to Stasis Webifier range and Target Painter effectiveness. In virtually any large fleet, a few Huginns will be present to web enemy ships (especially fast tackle or nano-HACs) from long distance, drastically slowing them. They also paint targets to increase their signature radius, improving hit quality for missiles and artillery.

- **Lachesis** (Gallente Combat Recon) – The Lachesis provides long-range warp disruption and sensor dampening. It has a huge bonus to disruptor/scrambler range, meaning a Lachesis can pin down targets from 50–70km away. Additionally, Lachesis pilots often fit remote sensor dampeners to either reduce enemy lock range or increase their lock time.

- **Curse** (Amarr Combat Recon) – The Curse is an electronic warfare cruiser with bonuses to energy neutralizer/vampire range and tracking disruptors. In fleet context, Curses operate as medium-range "neutralizing batteries" – for instance, a Curse can drain the capacitor of hostile logistics or heavy tackle from 30–40km away, rendering them helpless.

- **Rook** (Caldari Combat Recon) – The Rook is a non-cloaky ECM platform that trades the Falcon's stealth for slightly better tank and damage. In a fleet role, Rooks position at range and attempt to jam hostile ships continuously.

### Force Recons

- **Rapier** (Minmatar Force Recon) – The Rapier is the cloaking counterpart to the Huginn. It also has bonuses to web and painter range, though slightly lower webs than Huginn. Rapiers typically fit Covert Ops cloaks, allowing them to sneak into position and ambush. In fleet warfare, Rapiers are often used for covert operations: lighting covert cynos for black ops drops or uncloaking to web important enemy ships.

- **Arazu** (Gallente Force Recon) – The Arazu complements the Lachesis by adding a covert cloak. Arazus can lurk invisible and then surprise-tackle important enemy assets with long-range warp scramblers/disruptors. In subcap fleets, Arazus might cloak and maneuver onto the flank or behind enemy logi, then decloak to dampen and tackle them, causing chaos in the enemy's backline.

- **Pilgrim** (Amarr Force Recon) – The Pilgrim is the cloaked variant of the Curse. It is an ambush predator: often flown with a heavy neut/nos fit, it will cloak and approach key targets and then decloak at close range, apply multiple powerful energy neuts and possibly a scrambler to disable MWD/cap boosters.

- **Falcon** (Caldari Force Recon) – The Falcon is infamous for its ECM jamming capabilities with a covert cloak. Although ECM mechanics changed, Falcons are still used to break enemy target locks at critical moments. A Falcon in a fleet might decloak and jam all enemy logi or key ships at once for a short duration.

### Other EWAR Ships

- **Blackbird** (Tech I Cruiser) – The Blackbird deserves a mention as the low-cost ECM platform. Many alliances have fit up squads of cheap Blackbirds to jam enemy heavy hitters in fleets. They are extremely flimsy but so cheap that trading a few Blackbird losses to neutralize enemy firepower is worth it.

*Recon/EWAR ships are force multipliers – a handful can disrupt an enemy fleet's cohesiveness and enable your fleet to hit harder and survive longer. Most standard doctrines include at least a few dedicated recon pilots.*

## Interceptors and Fast Tackle

Fast tackle refers to the super-fast frigates that race ahead of the fleet to pin enemies down. Interceptors (T2 frigates) are the prime example, as they are virtually immune to bubbles (with Nullification) and extremely quick:

- **Stiletto** (Minmatar Interceptor) – A commonly used fleet interceptor, known for its speed and 4 mid slots perfect for tackle (warp disruptors/scrams and webs). Stilettos zoom around the battlespace, quickly locking and tackling targets with long point range.

- **Malediction** (Amarr Interceptor) – A favored armor-tanked interceptor, the Malediction can fit a decent armor buffer and still hit high speeds. It's used in armor fleets as a durable tackle that can survive a bit longer under defensive fire while holding an enemy down.

- **Ares** (Gallente Interceptor) – Ares is one of the fastest interceptors in straight-line speed. It has bonuses to warp scramble range and capacitors, making it reliable for long tackles. Ares often serve as quick tackle and fleet warp-ins.

- **Crow** (Caldari Interceptor) – The Crow is a combat-oriented interceptor with bonuses to missiles. It sacrifices a bit of speed compared to Stiletto/Ares, but in exchange it can apply some damage from range (light missiles).

*Interceptors have the unique trait of bubble immunity, which means they can chase targets even through bubble fields and are ideal for rapid response. Fleet commanders typically assign interceptor pilots roles like "catch anyone trying to warp off" or provide warp-ins for the fleet.*

## Command Destroyers (Micro Jump Field "Booshers")

Command Destroyers (CMDDs) are a support class of destroyers that can micro jump themselves and nearby ships 100 km in any direction using a Micro Jump Field Generator (MJFG). This ability, commonly called "booshing," has huge tactical applications in fleets:

- **Pontifex** (Amarr Command Destroyer) – An armor-tanked boosh ship often used in armor fleets. The Pontifex provides minor armor/shield bonuses and can mount an armor command burst, but most importantly it can boosh. In an armor battleship fleet vulnerable to bombing runs, a Pontifex might activate its MJFG to jump a cluster of friendly battleships 100km away the moment before bombs hit, saving them.

- **Stork** (Caldari Command Destroyer) – A shield-tanked command destroyer; common in shield fleets to counter bombs and herd the fleet. The Stork has bonuses to shield resist and often carries a shield command burst to slightly increase fleet shields. Stork pilots in a shield fleet are on standby to boosh friendlies out of danger or boosh enemies apart.

- **Bifrost** (Minmatar Command Destroyer) – The Bifrost is another shield command destroyer, similar in stats to the Stork but with Minmatar traits (skirmish burst bonus). Bifrosts are common in any fleet for their skirmish boost (e.g., giving a slight speed boost to all ships) and their booshing. They are often the preferred command dessie for nullsec alliances due to their flexibility.

- **Magus** (Gallente Command Destroyer) – The Magus is an armor command destroyer similar to the Pontifex but with Gallente flavor (often fits info or skirmish bursts). In armor HAC or mixed fleets, Maguses provide the same boosh utility.

- **Draugur** (Triglavian Command Destroyer) – A special mention: the Draugur is the Triglavian CMDD, obtained via Abyssal content. It has different bonuses and can be quite pricey. While not commonly seen in large null fleets (due to cost and rarity), it sometimes appears in elite wormhole or lowsec groups.

*In large-scale warfare, Command Destroyers are so influential that entire tactics revolve around them. Collectively referred to as "booshers," they can reposition up to 25 allied ships by 100km. Fleet commanders use this for: avoiding bomb damage, moving battleships across a void to chase the enemy, breaking up enemy logistics "balls," or extracting their own tackle.*
