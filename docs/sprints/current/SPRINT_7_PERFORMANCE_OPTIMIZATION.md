# Sprint 7: Performance Optimization

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-10  
**End Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Sprint Goal**: Optimize database queries, eliminate N+1 problems, and improve overall application performance to handle production-scale data.  
**Philosophy**: "If it takes more than 2 seconds to load, it's not production-ready."

   - `(killmail_time)` - Timeline queries
   - `(solar_system_id, killmail_time)` - System activity
   - `(victim_character_id, killmail_time)` - Character intelligence

2. **participants**:
   - `(character_id, killmail_time)` - Character activity
   - `(corporation_id, killmail_time)` - Corporation activity
   - `(ship_type_id, killmail_time)` - Ship usage analysis
   - `(killmail_id)` - Foreign key performance

3. **character_stats**:
   - `(character_id)` - Character lookups
   - `(corporation_id, dangerous_rating)` - Corp threat assessment

### Performance Targets
- zkillboard import: From >30s to <5s
- Battle analysis page load: From >10s to <2s
- Database queries: From 1000ms+ to <100ms
- N+1 queries: From 50+ to 1 per operation

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Database Optimization Strategy
1. **Query Analysis**: Use existing QueryPlanAnalyzer to identify slow queries
2. **Index Creation**: Add indexes for common WHERE clauses and JOINs
3. **Query Rewriting**: Replace memory filtering with database filtering
4. **Eager Loading**: Use Ash preloading to eliminate N+1 patterns

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Query Logging**: Enable detailed query logging with execution times
2. **Performance Telemetry**: Add telemetry for critical operations
3. **Health Checks**: Enhance existing health check with performance metrics
4. **Alerting**: Add warnings for queries exceeding thresholds

### Caching Strategy (Phase 1)
1. **Static Data Caching**: ETS-based cache for ship types, solar systems, items
2. **Batch Resolution**: Replace N+1 queries with single batch operations
3. **Cache Warming**: Pre-load common data at startup
4. **ETS Optimization**: Optimize existing ETS usage for fittings
5. **Query Result Caching**: Cache expensive calculation results
6. **Session Caching**: Cache user-specific data for session duration

### Existing Tools to Leverage
1. **QueryPlanAnalyzer**: Already in supervision tree, needs activation
2. **PerformanceOptimizer**: Database statistics and recommendations
3. **Mix Tasks**: `mix eve.analyze_performance` for manual analysis
4. **NameResolver**: Has caching infrastructure, needs optimization
