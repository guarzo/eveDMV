# Sprint 13: UI/UX Fixes & Navigation Improvements

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-15  
**End Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Sprint Goal**: Fix critical UI/UX issues and improve navigation consistency across the application  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

---

## üéØ Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Fix critical navigation, search, and user experience issues throughout the application to provide a consistent and functional user interface.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Navigation bar shows consistently across all pages with search and user info
- [ ] Search functionality works with autocomplete suggestions
- [ ] Dashboard shows real activity data and proper clickable elements
- [ ] Surveillance page loads quickly and shows proper connection status
- [ ] Battle analysis properly links kills to form battles
- [ ] Chain intelligence works with configured chain from environment

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- New feature development
- Backend performance optimization beyond fixing API issues
- Static data imports (EVE item types, etc.)
- Advanced analytics features

## üìã Detailed Issue Analysis

### Navigation Issues
1. **Search autocomplete missing** - Nav bar search needs suggestions
2. **Inconsistent navigation** - Character analysis and surveillance pages missing nav elements
3. **Missing user info** - Logged in user not shown consistently

### Dashboard Issues
4. **Non-clickable elements** - Character and corporation names should link to analysis
5. **Mock activity data** - Recent activity shows placeholder data
6. **Unnecessary buttons** - "View chain map" and "manage profiles" buttons should be removed
7. **Non-functional elements** - Chain activity and surveillance should be clickable

### Surveillance Issues
8. **Slow loading** - Page takes exceptionally long to load
9. **Connection status** - Shows "disconnected from default" instead of proper status
10. **Missing navigation** - Same nav issues as character analysis

### Battle Analysis Issues
11. **Kill linking** - Kills not properly linked to form battles
12. **Time range** - Should use longer time range for same people in system

### API Issues (from logs)
13. **DNS resolution** - nxdomain errors for API calls
14. **Chain topology** - Failed API calls to fetch chain data
15. **Zkillboard errors** - API returning 500 status
16. **Battle detection** - Battle not found in backend

### Other Issues
17. **Chain intelligence** - Should use env variable instead of user selection
18. **Logout page** - Should show login button instead of search bar

## üîí Critical Development Practices

### Incremental Changes & Validation
1. **Make Small, Atomic Changes**
   - One UI fix at a time
   - Test each change immediately
   - Commit after each working change

2. **Validate After Every Change**
   - Run `mix test` after each code change
   - Manually test the specific page/feature modified
   - Check that existing features still work
   - Run `mix phx.server` and test in browser

3. **Regression Testing Checklist**
   - [ ] Kill feed still displays real-time data
   - [ ] Authentication still works
   - [ ] Navigation between pages works
   - [ ] No new compilation warnings
   - [ ] No runtime errors in console

4. **Before Moving to Next Task**
   - Current UI fix works end-to-end
   - Tests pass
   - No regressions introduced
   - Code is committed with clear message

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 3 UI fixes that actually work than claim 8 fixes are "done" with placeholder implementations.
