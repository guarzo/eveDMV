# Sprint 15b: TODO Elimination Phase 2 - Critical Implementation Gaps

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-16  
**End Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Sprint Goal**: Complete high-priority TODO items and eliminate critical placeholder implementations  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done. If it has a TODO, it's not done."
