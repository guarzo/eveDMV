# Sprint 6: Battle Analysis MVP

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-09  
**End Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Sprint Goal**: Build a comprehensive battle analysis system that reconstructs EVE battles from killmail data with user-uploaded combat logs and fitting integration.  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

## üéØ Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Create a working battle analysis system that can reconstruct actual EVE battles from killmail data, with zkillboard integration and combat log parsing.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Battle detection algorithm successfully clusters killmails into discrete battles
- [ ] zkillboard smart import works - paste link, get full battle analysis
- [ ] Combat log upload and parsing provides additional battle insights
- [ ] Timeline visualization shows clear battle progression
- [ ] Ship performance analysis compares expected vs actual performance
- [ ] All features work with real battle data, no mocks

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Video integration (deferred to Sprint 7)
- Advanced tactical AI recommendations
- Multi-system battle tracking
- Battle simulation "what-if" scenarios
- Community features (voting, reports)

| BATTLE-4 | Battle analysis page with timeline visualization | 8 | HIGH | Clear timeline UI showing ship movements and kills |
| BATTLE-5 | Combat log upload and parsing functionality | 8 | MEDIUM | Parses EVE combat logs, integrates with killmail data |
| BATTLE-6 | Ship performance analysis (expected vs actual) | 5 | MEDIUM | Compares theoretical ship performance with actual |
| BATTLE-7 | Fitting integration (EFT/PyFA import) | 3 | MEDIUM | Imports ship fittings for performance analysis |
| BATTLE-8 | Battle metrics dashboard (ISK efficiency, DPS, etc) | 5 | MEDIUM | Real metrics calculated from battle data |

**Total Points**: 47

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
- **Battle Detection**: Time-based clustering with spatial correlation
- **Data Sources**: killmails_raw table, zkillboard API, user uploads
- **Storage**: New tables for battles, combat_logs, ship_fittings
- **UI**: LiveView with real-time updates for battle visualization

### Database Schema Changes
- `battles` table for battle metadata
- `battle_participants` table for ship involvement
- `combat_logs` table for user-uploaded logs
- `ship_fittings` table for fitting data

### Key Risks
1. **zkillboard API Rate Limits** - May need caching/throttling
2. **Combat Log Format Changes** - EVE client logs format may change
3. **Battle Detection Complexity** - Clustering algorithm may need tuning
4. **Performance** - Large battles may have performance issues

### Demo Scenarios
1. **B-R5RB Battle Reconstruction** - Show famous battle timeline
2. **Small Gang Analysis** - Upload combat log for detailed analysis
3. **Smart Import** - Paste zkill link, get instant battle breakdown
4. **Performance Comparison** - Show ship fitting vs actual performance

## üéØ MVP Success Definition

By sprint end, a user should be able to:
1. **Paste a zkillboard link** and get a complete battle analysis
2. **Upload their combat log** and see detailed performance metrics
3. **View a battle timeline** showing ship movements and kills
4. **Compare ship performance** against expected fitting values
5. **See battle metrics** like ISK efficiency and DPS

**Unique Value**: "The most comprehensive battle analysis tool in EVE Online - combining killmail data, combat logs, and fitting analysis in one place."
