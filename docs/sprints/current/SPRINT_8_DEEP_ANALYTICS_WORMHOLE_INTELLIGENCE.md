# Sprint 8: Deep Analytics & Wormhole Intelligence

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-10  
**End Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement sophisticated analytics algorithms for wormhole-focused PvP intelligence  
**Philosophy**: "Fewer features with sophisticated algorithms - quality over quantity."

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Transform existing analytics features from basic data display to sophisticated intelligence systems using advanced algorithms for wormhole PvP analysis.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Battle analysis can automatically detect and classify tactical phases using ML-style clustering
- [ ] Character threat scores accurately predict combat effectiveness using multi-dimensional analysis
- [ ] Multi-system battles are properly correlated and analyzed across wormhole chains
- [ ] Corporation intelligence provides actionable insights for wormhole operations
- [ ] Battle sharing system enables community curation with video integration
- [ ] All algorithms use real data and sophisticated calculations (zero placeholders)

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Route analysis (wormholes don't use gates)
- Economic activity tracking (limited wormhole markets)
- Strategic positioning analysis (no sovereignty in wormholes)
- Member recruitment pipelines (not wormhole community priority)
- Fleet Optimizer (deferred to future sprint)
- Advanced distributed caching (Redis integration)

## 🧠 Technical Implementation Details

### DEEP-1: Advanced Battle Analysis (10 points)

#### Multi-System Battle Tracking Algorithm
```elixir
defmodule EveDmv.BattleAnalysis.MultiSystemCorrelation do
  @moduledoc """
  Sophisticated algorithm to correlate battles across multiple wormhole systems.
  Uses temporal proximity, participant overlap, and system adjacency scoring.
  """
  
  def correlate_battles(battles) do
    battles
    |> temporal_clustering(max_gap: :timer.minutes(15))
    |> participant_overlap_analysis(min_overlap: 0.3)
    |> system_adjacency_scoring()
    |> merge_correlated_battles()
  end
end
```

#### Tactical Phase Detection
- **Setup Phase**: Low damage, positioning moves, EWAR deployment
- **Engagement Phase**: High damage, focus fire patterns, ship losses
- **Resolution Phase**: Cleanup, looting, extraction patterns
- **Algorithm**: K-means clustering on damage rate, ship movement, and engagement distance vectors

#### Ship Performance Analysis
- **DPS Efficiency**: Actual damage dealt vs theoretical maximum
- **Survivability Index**: Time alive vs expected based on ship class and fleet composition
- **Tactical Contribution**: EWAR applications, tackle effectiveness, logistics efficiency

### DEEP-2: Character Threat Intelligence (8 points)

#### Multi-Dimensional Threat Scoring
```elixir
defmodule EveDmv.Intelligence.ThreatScoring do
  def calculate_threat_score(character) do
    %{
      combat_skill: analyze_combat_performance(character),      # 30% weight
      ship_mastery: calculate_ship_diversity_score(character),  # 25% weight
      gang_effectiveness: measure_fleet_contribution(character), # 25% weight
      unpredictability: analyze_tactical_variance(character),   # 10% weight
      recent_activity: weight_recent_performance(character)     # 10% weight
    }
    |> weighted_threat_calculation()
  end
end
```

## 🎯 Success Definition

This sprint succeeds when EVE DMV transforms from a "killmail display tool" to a "wormhole intelligence platform" through:

1. **Sophisticated Battle Analysis**: Multi-system correlation, tactical phase detection, ship performance scoring
2. **Intelligent Threat Assessment**: Multi-dimensional character analysis with behavioral patterns
3. **Corporate Intelligence**: Combat doctrine recognition and threat level assessment
4. **Community Engagement**: Battle sharing with video integration and community curation
5. **Zero Placeholders**: All features use real data and sophisticated algorithms

**Philosophy**: "Each feature should provide insights that experienced wormhole pilots would find genuinely useful and that they cannot easily get elsewhere."
