## 📋 Detailed Implementation Plan

### High Priority Stories (29 points)

#### DASH-1: Real ISK Destroyed/Lost Calculations (8 points)
**Objective**: Replace placeholder ISK values with actual calculations from killmail data

**Implementation**:
```elixir
# Calculate real ISK destroyed by character
def calculate_isk_destroyed(character_id, period \\ :last_30_days) do
  time_filter = case period do
    :last_24h -> Timex.shift(DateTime.utc_now(), days: -1)
    :last_7d -> Timex.shift(DateTime.utc_now(), days: -7)
    :last_30d -> Timex.shift(DateTime.utc_now(), days: -30)
    :all_time -> ~U[2003-05-06 00:00:00Z]
  end
  
  KillmailRaw
  |> where([k], fragment("? = ANY(?)", ^character_id, k.attackers_character_ids))
  |> where([k], k.killmail_time >= ^time_filter)
  |> select([k], sum(k.total_value))
  |> Repo.one() || 0
end
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dashboard shows actual ISK destroyed/lost from database

**Objective**: Implement functional favorites system for characters, corporations, and battles

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_favorites (

  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  entity_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (entity_type IN ('character', 'corporation', 'battle')),
  entity_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  entity_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  custom_name VARCHAR(200),
  notes TEXT,
  favorited_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, entity_type, entity_id)
);
```

  # Multi-pilot killmails indicate fleet engagements
  KillmailRaw
  |> where([k], fragment("? = ANY(?)", ^character_id, k.attackers_character_ids))
  |> where([k], k.killmail_time >= ^days_ago(days))
  |> where([k], fragment("array_length(?, 1) > 5", k.attackers_character_ids))
  |> preload([:victim_ship_type, :solar_system])
  |> Repo.all()

## 🔒 Critical Development Practices

### Incremental Changes & Validation
1. **Make Small, Atomic Changes**
   - One feature at a time
   - Test each change immediately
   - Commit after each working change

2. **Validate After Every Change**
   - Run `mix test` after each code change
   - Manually test the specific feature modified
   - Check that existing features still work
   - Run `mix phx.server` and test in browser

3. **Regression Testing Checklist**
   - [ ] Kill feed still displays real-time data
   - [ ] Authentication still works
   - [ ] Navigation between pages works
   - [ ] No new compilation warnings
   - [ ] No runtime errors in console

4. **Before Moving to Next Task**
   - Current feature works end-to-end
   - Tests pass
   - No regressions introduced
   - Code is committed with clear message

---

## 📋 Implementation Notes

### Database Queries
All new features must use real database queries:
```elixir
# Example: Real ISK destroyed calculation
def calculate_isk_destroyed(character_id, period \\ :all_time) do
  KillmailRaw
  |> where([k], fragment("? = ANY(?)", ^character_id, k.attackers_character_ids))
  |> filter_by_period(period)
  |> select([k], sum(k.total_value))
  |> Repo.one()
end
```

### Character Data Integration
Use EVE ESI API for character information:
```elixir
def character_portrait_url(character_id, size \\ 256) do
  "https://images.evetech.net/characters/#{character_id}/portrait?size=#{size}"
end
```

### Real-time Updates
Integrate with existing PubSub system:
```elixir
def handle_info({:new_killmail, killmail}, socket) do
  # Update dashboard data when new killmails arrive
  updated_stats = recalculate_user_stats(socket.assigns.current_user.character_id)
  {:noreply, assign(socket, :stats, updated_stats)}
end
```

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 5 features that work with real data than claim 9 features are "done" with placeholder implementations.
