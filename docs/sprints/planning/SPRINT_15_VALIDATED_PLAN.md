## üîç Implementation Details

### User Favorites System Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  entity_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (entity_type IN ('character', 'corporation', 'battle')),
  entity_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  entity_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  custom_name VARCHAR(200),
  notes TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  favorited_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, entity_type, entity_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_favorites_user_id ON user_favorites(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_favorites_entity ON user_favorites(entity_type, entity_id);
```

### Janice API Integration Architecture
```elixir
defmodule EveDmv.MarketIntelligence.Infrastructure.JaniceClient do
  @janice_base_url "https://janice.e-351.com/api/rest/v2"
  
  def get_item_price(type_id) do
    with {:ok, response} <- HTTPoison.get("#{@janice_base_url}/appraisal", 
                                         headers: headers(),
                                         params: [items: [%{typeID: type_id, quantity: 1}]]) do
      parse_price_response(response)
    end
  end
  
  defp handle_rate_limit(response) do
    # Implement exponential backoff for rate limits
  end
end
```

### Character Search Implementation
```elixir
def search_characters(query, limit \\ 10) do
  # Search both local database and ESI
  local_results = search_local_characters(query, limit)
  
  if length(local_results) < limit do
    esi_results = search_esi_characters(query, limit - length(local_results))
    combine_and_deduplicate(local_results, esi_results)
  else
    local_results
  end
end
```

## üö® Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Janice API Integration** - External dependency with rate limits
   - *Mitigation*: Implement robust caching and fallback systems
   
2. **User Favorites Performance** - Could impact dashboard load times
   - *Mitigation*: Efficient queries with proper indexing
   
3. **Character Search Performance** - ESI API calls can be slow
   - *Mitigation*: Async search with loading states

### Critical Dependencies
- Janice API availability and documentation
- EVE ESI API for character search
- Database performance for favorites queries

---

## üöÄ Next Sprint Preview

**Sprint 16** should focus on:
1. **Advanced Intelligence Features**: Cross-system correlation, pattern analysis
2. **Wormhole Operations**: Chain topology, mass optimization
3. **Battle Analysis Enhancement**: Advanced tactical analysis
4. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization, caching strategies

---

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Priority Rationale
This sprint focuses on user-visible features first because:
- Dashboard currently shows placeholder data that undermines user trust
- Favorites system is essential for user retention and workflow
- Market valuation affects every killmail and fleet analysis
- Character search is fundamental to intelligence workflows

### Code Quality Focus
- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Database migrations must be reversible
- API integrations must handle failures gracefully
- UI components must show loading and error states

---

**Remember**: This sprint prioritizes finishing user-facing features over adding new advanced functionality. Every completed item should eliminate placeholder data and provide real value to users.
