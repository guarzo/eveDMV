## 🏗️ Detailed Refactoring Plans

### Massive File Splits (QUAL-16: 13 points)

#### ship_performance_analyzer.ex (2,099 lines)
**Split into focused analyzers:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv/contexts/battle_analysis/domain/
├── analyzers/
│   ├── dps_analyzer.ex           # Damage calculation and effectiveness
│   ├── survivability_analyzer.ex # Tank and defensive metrics
│   └── tactical_analyzer.ex      # Positioning and engagement patterns
└── ship_performance_coordinator.ex # Orchestrates the analyzers
```

**Migration strategy:**
1. Create analyzer interfaces/behaviors
2. Extract DPS logic first (lowest coupling)
3. Extract survivability logic
4. Extract tactical logic last (highest coupling)
5. Create coordinator that calls all analyzers
6. Update all references to use coordinator

#### character_analysis_live.ex (1,949 lines)
**Extract into components:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv_web/live/character_analysis/
├── character_analysis_live.ex    # Main LiveView (orchestration only)
├── components/
│   ├── character_header.ex       # Character info display
│   ├── statistics_panel.ex       # Stats and metrics
│   ├── recent_activity.ex        # Activity feed
│   └── threat_assessment.ex      # Threat scoring display
└── helpers/
    ├── character_data_formatter.ex
    └── statistics_calculator.ex
```

#### threat_scoring_engine.ex (1,808 lines)
**Split by threat domain:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv/contexts/combat_intelligence/domain/threat_scoring/
├── combat_threat_scorer.ex       # Combat-related threats
├── intelligence_threat_scorer.ex # Surveillance threats
├── fleet_threat_scorer.ex        # Fleet composition threats
└── threat_scoring_coordinator.ex # Orchestrates scoring
```

### Process Dictionary Elimination (QUAL-10: 3 points)

**Current pattern:**
```elixir
# Bad: Hidden mutable state
Process.put(:task_info, %{description: desc, start_time: now})
```

**New ETS-based approach:**
```elixir
# Good: Observable, crash-safe
:ets.insert(:task_metadata, {self(), %{description: desc, start_time: now}})

# Cleanup on task completion
:ets.delete(:task_metadata, self())
```

### Structured Logging (QUAL-11: 2 points)

**Implement consistent log format:**
```elixir
# Before
Logger.info("Task #{task_id} completed in #{duration}ms")

# After
Logger.info("Task completed", %{
  task_id: task_id,
  duration_ms: duration,
  status: :completed,
  supervisor: __MODULE__
})
```

### OpenTelemetry Integration (QUAL-14: 5 points)

**Add spans to task supervisors:**
```elixir
def start_task(fun, desc, timeout) do
  OpenTelemetry.with_span "task.execute", %{
    "task.description" => desc,
    "task.timeout" => timeout,
    "supervisor.module" => __MODULE__
  } do
    # Existing task logic
  end
end
```
