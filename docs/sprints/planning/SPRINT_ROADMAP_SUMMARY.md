- **Sprint 17**: ✅ Reasonable scope (architecture work)

### Dependency Chain
```
Sprint 15 → Sprint 16 → Sprint 17
    ↓           ↓           ↓
User Trust → Intelligence → Sustainability
```

## 🔄 Validation Against Current State

### Already Implemented ✅
Based on codebase analysis, these items are **already functional**:

**Dashboard Real Data (Sprint 14 scope)**:
- ✅ Real ISK destroyed/lost calculations from killmail data
- ✅ Real kill/loss counts with SQL queries
- ✅ Real recent combat activity from database
- ✅ Real threat scoring using ThreatScoringEngine

**Fleet Operations**:
- ✅ Real fleet composition analysis
- ✅ Real ship distribution and role classification
- ✅ Real pilot performance calculations

**Character Intelligence**:
- ✅ Real threat analysis from combat data
- ✅ Real behavioral pattern detection
- ✅ Real combat statistics and efficiency

### Still Placeholder/Mock 🔴
These items need Sprint 15 implementation:

**User Experience**:
- 🔴 User favorites system (UI exists, no backend)
- 🔴 Character search (returns empty results)
- 🔴 Chain activity (hardcoded "J123456" data)
- 🔴 Surveillance alerts (hardcoded mock data)

**Market Intelligence**:
- 🔴 External price integration (Janice API not connected)
- 🔴 Limited ship coverage (only 26 hardcoded ships)
- 🔴 Basic item valuation (crude type_id ranges)

## 📈 Sprint 15 Priority Adjustment

Based on validation, **Sprint 15 scope should be reduced** to focus on highest-impact items:

### Adjusted Sprint 15 (Recommended)
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Points**: ~55 (More realistic)

**Phase 1 - Critical (Week 1)**:
- UX-1: User favorites system (8 pts) 
- UX-2: Character search fix (5 pts)
- VAL-1: Janice API integration (8 pts)

**Phase 2 - High Value (Week 2)**:
- UX-4: Complete character profile (8 pts)
- VAL-2: Enhanced item valuation (8 pts)
- UX-5: Replace dashboard mock data (8 pts)

**Deferred to Sprint 16**:
- UX-3: Character comparison (5 pts)
- VAL-3: Ship coverage expansion (5 pts)
- TODO items (26 pts)

## 🎯 Success Criteria by Sprint

### Sprint 15 Success
- **User Trust**: No visible placeholder data in user workflows
- **Core Functionality**: Favorites, search, and valuation work reliably
- **Data Accuracy**: Prices reflect real market values

### Sprint 16 Success  
- **Intelligence Value**: Threat assessments provide actionable insights
- **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced analytics unavailable elsewhere
- **System Integration**: All components work together seamlessly

### Sprint 17 Success
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings, comprehensive testing
- **Performance**: System scales efficiently under load
- **Maintainability**: New features can be added quickly

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Sprint 15 Risks
- **Janice API Integration**: May hit rate limits or documentation issues
  - *Mitigation*: Implement robust fallback to existing price estimates
- **Character Search Performance**: ESI API calls may be slow
  - *Mitigation*: Implement caching and async loading states

### Sprint 16 Risks  
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Advanced intelligence may be computationally expensive
  - *Mitigation*: Implement background processing and caching
- **Scope Creep**: Very aggressive point estimate
  - *Mitigation*: Pre-defined deferral plan for Phase 3 items

### Sprint 17 Risks
- **Supervisor Migration**: Risk of breaking existing functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Gradual migration with extensive testing

## 📊 Resource Planning

### Development Capacity Assumptions
- **Sprint Points per Week**: ~25-30 points (based on historical velocity)
- **Sprint 15**: 55 points ÷ 2 weeks = 27.5 points/week ✅ Achievable
- **Sprint 16**: 135 points ÷ 3 weeks = 45 points/week ⚠️ Very aggressive
- **Sprint 17**: 95 points ÷ 2 weeks = 47.5 points/week ⚠️ High but acceptable for architecture

### Recommendation
- **Sprint 15**: Execute as planned with adjusted scope
- **Sprint 16**: Plan for deferral of 30-40 points to Sprint 18
- **Sprint 17**: Consider extending to 3 weeks if Sprint 16 items deferred
