# Sprint 15D: Placeholder Elimination

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-17  
**End Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Sprint Goal**: Replace critical placeholder implementations with real functionality  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

---

## üéØ Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Eliminate high-priority placeholder implementations and replace them with real database-driven functionality.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Character intelligence functions return real calculated data instead of mock responses
- [ ] Battle analysis services implement actual algorithms instead of `:not_implemented` errors
- [ ] Threat assessment queries real data from database instead of generating sample data
- [ ] All implemented features pass the "no mock data" rule from CLAUDE.md

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Test file mock functions (these are supposed to mock)
- UI placeholder text/labels (cosmetic only)
- Complete fleet operations overhaul (too large for this sprint)
- Wormhole operations implementation (deferred to next sprint)

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Claiming Completion Without Evidence**
   - Always require screenshots or demo
   - Test in actual browser, not just unit tests

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Explicitly list what's NOT in scope
   - Resist adding "just one more thing"

3. **Ignoring Technical Debt**
   - Track it, plan for it
   - Don't let it accumulate silently

4. **Overestimating Capacity**
   - Use actual velocity from previous sprints
   - Account for meetings, reviews, testing

5. **Documentation Drift**
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Remove outdated information immediately

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 3 features that actually work than claim 10 features are "done" with mock data.
