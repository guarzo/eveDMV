# Sprint 15A: Performance Optimization for Historical Data

**Duration**: 6 weeks (extended sprint due to scope)  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-16  
**End Date**: 2025-02-27  
**Sprint Goal**: Optimize EVE DMV for large-scale historical killmail processing  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Optimize EVE DMV system to efficiently handle millions of historical killmails with sub-200ms query response times and 10x faster import speeds.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Corporation member queries execute in <200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Historical import speed reaches >10,000 killmails/minute
- [ ] LiveView memory usage reduced by 60-80%

## 📁 Performance Optimization Details

### Phase 1: Database Optimization (Weeks 1-2)
#### Critical N+1 Query Fixes
- **Target**: Corporation member loading in `corporation_live.ex:252-274`
- **Solution**: Implement `BatchNameResolver.preload_participant_names`
- **Expected Impact**: 50-90% reduction in database load

#### Database Aggregation Views
```sql
-- Character activity summary materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW character_activity_summary AS
SELECT 
  character_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN NOT is_victim THEN 1 END) as kills,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_victim THEN 1 END) as losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN NOT is_victim THEN total_value END) as isk_destroyed
FROM participants p
JOIN killmails_raw k ON p.killmail_id = k.killmail_id
GROUP BY character_id;
```

#### Critical Database Indexes
```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY killmails_raw_victim_corp_time_idx 
ON killmails_raw (victim_corporation_id, killmail_time DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY killmails_raw_system_value_idx 
ON killmails_raw (solar_system_id, ((raw_data->>'zkb'->>'totalValue')::numeric) DESC);
```

### Phase 2: Broadway Pipeline Optimization (Weeks 2-3)
#### Configuration Optimization
```bash
# High-performance settings
BATCH_SIZE=100                    # Increase from 10
BATCH_TIMEOUT=30000              # Increase from 5000ms  
PIPELINE_CONCURRENCY=12          # Increase from 4
BATCHER_CONCURRENCY=4            # Increase from 2
```

#### Memory-Efficient SSE Processing
- **Target**: Buffer overflow prevention in `httpoison_sse_producer.ex:86`
- **Solution**: Implement 1MB buffer limit with overflow handling
- **Expected Impact**: Prevent memory leaks during high-volume processing

### Phase 3: LiveView Memory Optimization (Weeks 3-4)
#### Stream Implementation
- **Target**: Convert large data lists to LiveView streams
- **Files**: `corporation_live.ex`, `surveillance_live.ex`, `battle_analysis_live.ex`
- **Expected Impact**: 60-80% reduction in memory usage

#### Pagination Implementation
- **Target**: Large dataset queries with pagination
- **Solution**: Implement cursor-based pagination for member lists
- **Expected Impact**: Bounded memory usage regardless of dataset size

### Phase 4: Cache Optimization (Weeks 4-5)

- **Solution**: Implement ETS secondary index for pattern matching
- **Expected Impact**: 90%+ faster cache operations

### Phase 5: Historical Import Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
#### Bulk Import Implementation
```elixir
defmodule EveDmv.HistoricalImport do
  def import_historical_data(source_file) do
    source_file
    |> File.stream!()
    |> Stream.map(&Jason.decode!/1)
    |> Stream.chunk_every(1000)
    |> Stream.map(&process_batch/1)
    |> Stream.run()
  end
end
```

#### Progress Monitoring
- **Target**: Real-time import progress tracking
- **Solution**: GenServer-based progress monitor with telemetry
- **Expected Impact**: Visibility into import performance and bottlenecks

## 🔒 Critical Development Practices

### Performance Testing Requirements
1. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Measure current performance before optimization
   - Document query execution plans
   - Profile memory usage patterns

2. **Optimization Validation**
   - Measure performance after each optimization
   - Compare with baseline metrics
   - Ensure no regression in functionality

3. **Load Testing**
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Validate under concurrent load
   - Monitor resource usage during tests

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```elixir
# Performance tracking implementation
defmodule EveDmv.PerformanceMonitor do
  def track_query_performance(query_name, duration) do
    :telemetry.execute([:eve_dmv, :query, :duration], 
      %{duration: duration}, %{query: query_name})
  end
  
  def track_memory_usage(process_name, memory_bytes) do
    :telemetry.execute([:eve_dmv, :memory, :usage], 
      %{bytes: memory_bytes}, %{process: process_name})
  end
end
```

## 🚨 Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migration Impact**: Materialized views may require maintenance windows
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Pattern changes may temporarily reduce cache effectiveness
3. **Memory Optimization**: LiveView changes may affect user experience

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy optimizations in phases
2. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert each optimization
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during deployment

### Contingency Plans
1. **Performance Regression**: Immediate rollback procedure
2. **Memory Issues**: Fallback to previous LiveView implementation
3. **Import Failures**: Gradual batch size increases with monitoring

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 3 optimizations that show measurable improvement than claim 10 optimizations are "done" without performance metrics.
