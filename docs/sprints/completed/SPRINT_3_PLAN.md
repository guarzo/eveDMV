# Sprint 3: "Polish & Stabilize" Plan

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (2025-01-08 to 2025-01-22)  
**Sprint Goal**: Fix runtime errors, improve stability, and polish Character Intelligence  

## üéâ Day 1 Summary
**Completed**: 13 story points (3 major stories)
- ‚úÖ Runtime errors fixed
- ‚úÖ Static data now complete (49,894 items)
- ‚úÖ Character Analysis page polished
- üóëÔ∏è Removed duplicate Character Intel page  

## ‚úÖ Completed 

### Story 1: Fix Runtime Errors (Day 1)
**Status**: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**What we fixed:**
1. **Participant Foreign Key Errors**
   - Removed foreign key constraint on `participants.ship_type_id`
   - Added index for performance
   - Participants now insert successfully even with unknown ship types

2. **Enriched Killmail Field Errors**
   - Modified `extract_system_data` to only return accepted fields
   - Removed unsupported fields (region_id, constellation_id, etc.)
   - Pipeline now processes without field mismatch errors

**Impact**: Logs are now much cleaner, pipeline is more stable

### Story 7: Static Data Completeness (Day 1)
**Status**: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**What we fixed:**
1. **Missing Ships Issue**
   - Discovered published field filter was too restrictive
   - Removed published filter entirely
   - Fixed numeric overflow issues for celestial objects
   - Now have 49,894 items including 535 ships

**Impact**: All EVE ships now available in database

### Story 2: Character Intel UI/UX Polish (Day 1)
**Status**: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**What we accomplished:**
1. **Fixed Duplicate Page Issue**
   - Discovered CharacterIntelLive was duplicate of CharacterAnalysisLive
   - Removed /intel route and consolidated to /analysis
   - Applied all improvements to correct page

2. **UI Improvements Implemented**
   - Added character portraits with proper image URLs
   - Added ship images in Ships & Weapons card
   - Combined ship and weapon data into single card
   - Added corp/alliance logos for flight partners
   - Fixed "Most Active Day" and "Days Active" to show real data
   - Removed duplicate Character ID display
   - Removed debug labels and "Real Data Source" text

**Impact**: Character Analysis page now polished and professional

## üìã Remaining Sprint Work

### Story 3: Simplify Enriched/Raw Architecture (5 pts)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: TODO

**Analysis Needed:**
1. Document what enrichment SHOULD do
2. Decide: Keep, remove, or actually implement enrichment
3. Consider performance implications

**Options:**
- **Option A**: Remove enriched table entirely
- **Option B**: Implement real enrichment (ship names, verified data)
- **Option C**: Use enriched as a materialized view for queries

### Story 4: Error Monitoring & Alerting (2 pts)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: TODO

**Implementation:**
1. **Structured Logging**
   - Log missing ship types with IDs
   - Track enrichment failures
   - Monitor pipeline health metrics

2. **Error Dashboard**
   ```elixir
   defmodule EveDmvWeb.Admin.ErrorDashboardLive do
     # Show:
     # - Missing ship types count
     # - Failed enrichments
     # - Pipeline throughput
     # - Error rates by type
   end
   ```

3. **Alerts**
   - High error rate notifications
   - Pipeline stall detection
   - Missing data alerts

### Story 3: Simplify Enriched/Raw Architecture (5 pts)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: TODO

**Analysis Needed:**
1. Document what enrichment SHOULD do
2. Decide: Keep, remove, or actually implement enrichment
3. Consider performance implications

**Options:**
- **Option A**: Remove enriched table entirely
- **Option B**: Implement real enrichment (ship names, verified data)
- **Option C**: Use enriched as a materialized view for queries

### Story 5: Performance Optimization (3 pts)
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: TODO

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Database Indexes**
   - Analyze slow queries with EXPLAIN
   - Add missing indexes
   - Optimize hot query paths

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Fix N+1 queries in character analysis
   - Add strategic caching
   - Batch API calls

3. **LiveView Optimization**
   - Reduce payload sizes
   - Debounce rapid updates
   - Optimize presence tracking

### Story 6: Add Character Intel Features (3 pts)
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: TODO

**New Features:**
1. **Frequent Fleetmates** - Who they fly with most
2. **Nemesis Analysis** - Top killers/victims
3. **Predictive Activity** - "Usually active now"
4. **Ship Fitting Patterns** - Common weapon combinations

## üìä Sprint Metrics

### Definition of Done
- [ ] No participant insertion errors in logs
- [ ] No enriched killmail field errors
- [ ] Static data includes basic ships
- [ ] Character Intel page loads in <2s
- [ ] Error rate <1% for pipeline processing

### Daily Checklist
- [ ] Check error logs for new issues
- [ ] Monitor pipeline throughput
- [ ] Test character intel with 5 random characters
- [ ] Verify no regression in kill feed

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. **Stability**: 24 hours without critical errors
2. **Performance**: Page loads consistently fast
3. **Completeness**: Basic ships appear in kill feed
4. **Polish**: Character Intel feels production-ready

## üìù Technical Debt to Track

1. **Static Data Loading Process**
   - No automatic updates
   - No validation of completeness
   - Manual process to refresh

2. **Enrichment Pipeline**
   - Not actually enriching
   - Duplicating data
   - Unclear purpose

3. **Error Handling**
   - Silent failures in some areas
   - No centralized error tracking
   - Limited recovery mechanisms

## üöÄ Next Sprint Preview

After stabilization, consider:
1. **Battle Analysis MVP** - Group kills into battles
2. **Corporation Intelligence** - Corp-level analytics  
3. **Surveillance System** - Working alerts
4. **API Integration** - Janice prices, ESI verification
