# Reality Check Sprint 1 - Daily Standups

## Day 1 - 2025-01-08

**Yesterday**: N/A (Sprint start)

**Today Completed**:
- ✅ Created new project governance documents:
  - ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATE.md - Honest assessment of what works
  - REALITY_CHECK_SPRINT_1.md - 2-week sprint plan
  - STUB_AUDIT.md - Comprehensive list of all placeholder code
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with critical "Definition of Done" rule
- ✅ Started marking stub implementations:
  - Battle Analysis Service - All stubs now return {:error, :not_implemented}
  - Wormhole Operations services - All marked as not implemented
  - Market Intelligence Valuation - Returns error instead of zeros
  - Member Activity Analyzer - No longer returns hardcoded test data
- ✅ Updated UI to handle not_implemented errors gracefully:
  - Battle Analysis page shows "Coming Soon" message
  - Removed hardcoded recent battles data

**Blockers**: None

**Real Implementation Count**: 0 functions use real data (starting point)
**Remaining Stubs**: ~50+ functions still return mock data

**Tomorrow's Plan**:
- Continue marking remaining stub implementations
- Update more UI components to handle :not_implemented
- Start reviewing test suite for stub-dependent tests

**Notes**:
- The codebase has far more stubs than initially apparent
- Many services are just shells with proper structure but no real logic
- UI gracefully degrading to "Coming Soon" is working well
