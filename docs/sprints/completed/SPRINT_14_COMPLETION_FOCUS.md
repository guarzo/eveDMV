# Sprint 14: Completion & Polish Focus

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-16  
**End Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Sprint Goal**: Complete remaining UI/UX fixes, address critical bugs, and ensure all features work with real data  
**Philosophy**: "Ship working features, not promises"

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Complete the remaining Sprint 13 items and address the most critical issues preventing a polished, production-ready experience. Focus on finishing what's started rather than adding new features.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All Sprint 13 remaining items completed
- [ ] Surveillance page loads quickly with proper connection status
- [ ] Dashboard simplified and unnecessary elements removed
- [ ] API error handling implemented and tested
- [ ] Battle analysis properly groups kills into battles
- [ ] All features work with real data (no mocks)
- [ ] Critical bugs from logs are fixed

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- New feature development
- Major architectural changes
- Features not started in previous sprints
- Performance optimization beyond fixing blocking issues

## 🔍 Definition of "Done" for This Sprint

A feature is ONLY done when:
1. It works with real data from the database
2. It handles errors gracefully with user feedback
3. It has loading and empty states
4. It performs acceptably (<3s load time)
5. The code has no TODO comments
6. It works on desktop and mobile

## 🔥 Sprint Priority & Scope Management

Given the aggressive 79 points, here's the priority order if we need to cut scope:

### Must Have (Critical/High Priority - 47 points)
1. TECH-5: Fix User model aliases (1 pt) - **Blocks compilation**
2. BUG-1: Fix DNS resolution (3 pts)
3. S13-2: Fix surveillance connection (3 pts)
4. S13-3: Improve surveillance loading (5 pts)
5. S13-4: API error handling (5 pts)
6. BUG-2: Fix zkillboard errors (3 pts)
7. BUG-3: Fix battle detection (5 pts)
8. FEAT-1: Battle kill grouping (5 pts)
9. TECH-1: Fix HomeDefenseAnalyzer (2 pts)
10. TECH-3: Handle MassOptimizer (3 pts)
11. TECH-4: Fix duplicate ship ID (1 pt)
12. TECH-6: Dynamic connection status (2 pts)
13. BUG-4: Chain topology failures (3 pts)
14. TECH-7: Historical import logic (5 pts) - **Critical for data population**

### Should Have (Medium Priority - 21 points)
15. FEAT-2: Character analysis page (8 pts)
16. FEAT-3: Corporation analysis page (8 pts)
17. FEAT-4: System analysis page (5 pts)

### Nice to Have (Low Priority - 11 points)
18. TECH-2: Ship role refactor (3 pts)
19. QA-1: Loading states (3 pts)
20. QA-2: Empty states (3 pts)
21. QA-3: Mobile responsiveness (2 pts)
22. S13-1: Remove dashboard cards (2 pts)

**Recommendation**: Focus on completing all "Must Have" items first (47 points). This is still achievable and addresses all critical issues including data population. Then move to "Should Have" items as time permits.

## 📊 Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **API Integration Issues** - External APIs may continue to fail
   - Mitigation: Add fallbacks and caching
   
2. **Performance Problems** - Surveillance page queries may be slow
   - Mitigation: Add pagination and limit initial data
   
3. **Scope Creep** - Temptation to add new features
   - Mitigation: Strict focus on completion only

### Dependencies
- EVE SSO API availability
- zkillboard API stability
- Database query performance

---

## 🎯 Sprint Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 80% of points completed
- **Bug Reduction**: 50% fewer errors in logs
- **Performance**: All pages load in <3 seconds
- **Quality**: No placeholder data in any shipped feature

---

## 🚀 Next Sprint Preview

Based on this sprint's outcomes, Sprint 15 should focus on:
1. **If successful**: Move to new feature development (Fleet tools, Wormhole features)
2. **If partially successful**: Continue polish and stability work
3. **If struggling**: Reduce scope and focus on core features only

---

## 📝 Notes

- This sprint is about FINISHING, not STARTING
- Every item should make the app more polished and production-ready
- If we can't complete something properly, we should remove it rather than ship it half-done
- User experience is the priority - they should never see errors, long loads, or broken features

Remember: "It's better to have 5 features that work perfectly than 10 features that work sometimes."
