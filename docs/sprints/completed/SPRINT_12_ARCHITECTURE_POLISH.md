## üìã TODO Items Analysis & Review

### Overview
Found **48 TODO comments** across the codebase representing systematic placeholder implementations. These were created during previous sprints to avoid Dialyzer type errors while building the UI structure.

### TODO Categories & Recommendations

#### üî¥ **High Priority - Address in Sprint 12** (7 TODOs)
**Impact**: Core functionality, user experience, foundation for other features

| Domain | File | Line | TODO | Recommendation | Effort |
|--------|------|------|------|----------------|--------|
| **Authentication** | `surveillance_profiles_live.ex` | 715 | Get from session/assigns when authentication is properly integrated | ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT** - Easy fix affecting UX | 1 day |
| **Market Intelligence** | `valuation_service.ex` | 14 | Implement real killmail valuation | ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT** - Required for ISK calculations | 2 days |

**Total Medium Priority**: 6 sprints

#### üü¢ **Low Priority - Technical Debt** (20 TODOs)
**Impact**: Nice-to-have features, advanced wormhole operations

| Domain | Count | Examples | Recommendation | Effort |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Wormhole Operations** | 18 | Mass optimization, chain intelligence, home defense | üóëÔ∏è **REMOVE** - Complex domain-specific features | 4+ sprints |

| **Caching Systems** | 1 | Analysis cache score aggregation | üóëÔ∏è **REMOVE OR DEFER** - Performance optimization | 2 days |

**Total Low Priority**: 5+ sprints

### üéØ **Sprint 12 Action Plan**

#### Phase 1: TODO Comment Cleanup (Days 1-3)
1. **Remove Non-Essential TODOs**: Delete 20 wormhole operation TODOs and replace with GitHub issues
2. **Convert Medium Priority**: Create properly scoped GitHub issues for combat intelligence and fleet operations
3. **Document Decisions**: Update comments to reflect implementation decisions

#### Phase 2: High Priority Implementation (Days 4-10)
1. **Authentication Integration** - Fix session/assigns access
2. **Market Intelligence** - Implement killmail and fleet valuation 
3. **Battle Analysis Foundation** - Real killmail fetching and ship classification
4. **Fleet Operations** - Proper Ash queries for composition analysis

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Days 11-14)
1. **Integration Testing** - Ensure new implementations work with existing data
2. **Performance Testing** - Validate database queries perform well
3. **Documentation Updates** - Update API documentation for implemented features

### üìä **TODO Resolution Metrics**

#### Sprint 12 Targets:
- **TODOs Removed**: 20 low-priority items (40% reduction)
- **TODOs Implemented**: 7 high-priority items (foundation features)
- **TODOs Converted to Issues**: 21 medium-priority items (proper tracking)
- **Net TODO Reduction**: 27 items (56% reduction from 48 to 21)

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All authentication-related TODOs resolved
- [ ] Basic market intelligence operational
- [ ] Ship classification system working
- [ ] Battle analysis queries implemented
- [ ] All remaining TODOs have GitHub issues
- [ ] No TODO comments in production code without tracking

### üîç **TODO Review Questions for Discussion**

1. **Wormhole Operations**: These 18 TODOs represent a complete feature. Should we:
   - Remove all and create epic for future development?
   - Keep 3-4 most important and remove the rest?
   - Convert to issues but mark as "future enhancement"?

2. **Combat Intelligence**: The 6 scoring TODOs are tightly coupled. Should we:
   - Implement basic versions in Sprint 12?
   - Create a complete intelligence scoring epic?
   - Focus on one scoring type (danger rating) as foundation?

3. **Market Intelligence**: These 2 TODOs are foundational. Should we:
   - Implement with external API integration (Janice)?
   - Create simple internal price estimation first?
   - Focus on EVE market data integration?

4. **Battle Analysis**: These 7 TODOs range from basic to advanced. Should we:
   - Implement all basic queries in Sprint 12?
   - Focus on killmail fetching and ship classification only?
   - Create progressive enhancement roadmap?

5. **Testing TODOs**: These 3 TODOs are in test files. Should we:
   - Remove them entirely (testing is supporting work)?
   - Implement them to improve test coverage?
   - Convert to testing improvement issues?

## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Refactoring Plans

### Massive File Splits (QUAL-16: 13 points)

#### ship_performance_analyzer.ex (2,099 lines)
**Split into focused analyzers:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv/contexts/battle_analysis/domain/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyzers/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dps_analyzer.ex           # Damage calculation and effectiveness
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ survivability_analyzer.ex # Tank and defensive metrics
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tactical_analyzer.ex      # Positioning and engagement patterns
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ship_performance_coordinator.ex # Orchestrates the analyzers
```

**Migration strategy:**
1. Create analyzer interfaces/behaviors
2. Extract DPS logic first (lowest coupling)
3. Extract survivability logic
4. Extract tactical logic last (highest coupling)
5. Create coordinator that calls all analyzers
6. Update all references to use coordinator

#### character_analysis_live.ex (1,949 lines)
**Extract into components:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv_web/live/character_analysis/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character_analysis_live.ex    # Main LiveView (orchestration only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character_header.ex       # Character info display
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ statistics_panel.ex       # Stats and metrics
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recent_activity.ex        # Activity feed
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ threat_assessment.ex      # Threat scoring display
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character_data_formatter.ex
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ statistics_calculator.ex
```

#### threat_scoring_engine.ex (1,808 lines)
**Split by threat domain:**

```elixir
# New structure
lib/eve_dmv/contexts/combat_intelligence/domain/threat_scoring/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combat_threat_scorer.ex       # Combat-related threats
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intelligence_threat_scorer.ex # Surveillance threats
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fleet_threat_scorer.ex        # Fleet composition threats
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ threat_scoring_coordinator.ex # Orchestrates scoring
```

### Process Dictionary Elimination (QUAL-10: 3 points)

**Current pattern:**
```elixir
# Bad: Hidden mutable state
Process.put(:task_info, %{description: desc, start_time: now})
```

**New ETS-based approach:**
```elixir
# Good: Observable, crash-safe
:ets.insert(:task_metadata, {self(), %{description: desc, start_time: now}})

# Cleanup on task completion
:ets.delete(:task_metadata, self())
```

### Structured Logging (QUAL-11: 2 points)

**Implement consistent log format:**
```elixir
# Before
Logger.info("Task #{task_id} completed in #{duration}ms")

# After
Logger.info("Task completed", %{
  task_id: task_id,
  duration_ms: duration,
  status: :completed,
  supervisor: __MODULE__
})
```

### OpenTelemetry Integration (QUAL-14: 5 points)

**Add spans to task supervisors:**
```elixir
def start_task(fun, desc, timeout) do
  OpenTelemetry.with_span "task.execute", %{
    "task.description" => desc,
    "task.timeout" => timeout,
    "supervisor.module" => __MODULE__
  } do
    # Existing task logic
  end
end
```
