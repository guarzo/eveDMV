# Sprint 8: Deep Analytics & Wormhole Intelligence

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-10  
**End Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement sophisticated analytics algorithms for wormhole-focused PvP intelligence  
**Philosophy**: "Fewer features with sophisticated algorithms - quality over quantity."

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Route analysis (wormholes don't use gates)
- Economic activity tracking (limited wormhole markets)
- Strategic positioning analysis (no sovereignty in wormholes)
- Member recruitment pipelines (not wormhole community priority)
- Fleet Optimizer (deferred to future sprint)
- Advanced distributed caching (Redis integration)

## 🎯 Success Definition

This sprint succeeds when EVE DMV transforms from a "killmail display tool" to a "wormhole intelligence platform" through:

1. **Sophisticated Battle Analysis**: Multi-system correlation, tactical phase detection, ship performance scoring
2. **Intelligent Threat Assessment**: Multi-dimensional character analysis with behavioral patterns
3. **Corporate Intelligence**: Combat doctrine recognition and threat level assessment
4. **Community Engagement**: Battle sharing with video integration and community curation
5. **Zero Placeholders**: All features use real data and sophisticated algorithms

**Philosophy**: "Each feature should provide insights that experienced wormhole pilots would find genuinely useful and that they cannot easily get elsewhere."
