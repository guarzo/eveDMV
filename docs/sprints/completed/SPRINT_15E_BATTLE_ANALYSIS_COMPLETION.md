# Sprint 15E: Battle Analysis & Service Completion

**Duration**: 2 weeks (standard)  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-18  
**End Date**: 2025-02-01  
**Sprint Goal**: Complete remaining placeholder implementations from Sprint 15D with focus on battle analysis  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

---

## üéØ Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Complete the remaining high-priority placeholder implementations from Sprint 15D, with primary focus on battle analysis service and cache management functionality.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Battle analysis service returns actual battle metrics from killmail data
- [ ] Cache management system performs real hash calculations and invalidation
- [ ] Search suggestion backend queries real database instead of mock data
- [ ] All new features pass comprehensive manual testing
- [ ] No regression in existing threat assessment functionality

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Fleet operations overhaul (saved for Sprint 15F)
- Wormhole operations implementation (deferred)
- Corporation analysis algorithm redesign (too large)
- UI component library expansion (not critical)
- Performance optimization beyond basic caching

## üîß Implementation Notes

### Sprint 15D Learnings Applied
- **Real Database First**: All new features must query actual data
- **No Process Mocking**: Avoid any Process dictionary usage
- **Performance Considerations**: Add caching where appropriate
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks for insufficient data
- **Testing Strategy**: Both unit and integration tests required

### Dependencies and Risks
- **Battle Analysis**: Requires understanding of EVE combat mechanics
- **Cache Management**: Must integrate with existing intelligence cache
- **Search Performance**: May need database indexing improvements
- **Token Refresh**: Depends on EVE SSO API stability

### Technical Debt Considerations
- Some template function references may need cleanup
- Intelligence component integration warnings to address
- Unused import warnings from previous work

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Claiming Completion Without Evidence**
   - Always require screenshots or demo
   - Test in actual browser, not just unit tests

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Explicitly list what's NOT in scope
   - Resist adding "just one more thing"

3. **Ignoring Technical Debt**
   - Track it, plan for it
   - Don't let it accumulate silently

4. **Overestimating Capacity**
   - Use actual velocity from previous sprints
   - Account for meetings, reviews, testing

5. **Documentation Drift**
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Remove outdated information immediately

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 3 features that actually work than claim 6 features are "done" with mock data.
