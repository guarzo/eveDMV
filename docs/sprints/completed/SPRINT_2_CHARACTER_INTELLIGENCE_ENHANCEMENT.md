- Proved our infrastructure can deliver real intelligence value

---

## 🎯 Sprint 2 Objectives

### Primary Goal: Enhanced Character Intelligence
Systematically add the advanced features we planned, building on our working foundation.

### Secondary Goal: Core User Experience Fixes  
Fix the most visible issues users encounter when using the application.

## 📋 Sprint 2 Backlog

### HIGH PRIORITY - Character Intelligence Enhancements

**Story 1: Ship + Weapon Preferences (5 pts)**

**Story 2: ISK Efficiency & Value Analysis (3 pts)**
- Restore ISK efficiency calculations with proper null handling
- Show ISK destroyed vs ISK lost with safe arithmetic
- **Definition of Done**: Accurate ISK efficiency percentages

**Story 3: Recent External Groups (5 pts)**
- Show corps/alliances character has killed with (not their own)
- 15-day window: "Flown with: Pandemic Horde Inc. (12 shared kills)"
- **Definition of Done**: Real external group detection from killmail data

**Story 4: Gang Size Pattern Analysis (4 pts)**
- Analyze solo vs small gang vs fleet behavior
- Categories: Solo, <5, <10, >20 attackers per killmail
- **Definition of Done**: Accurate gang size classifications

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Core Application Fixes

**Story 5: Character Name Resolution (3 pts)**
- Display actual character name on Character Analysis page
- Resolve character ID to name via ESI or static data
- Show "Character Name (ID: 12345)" format instead of just ID
- **Definition of Done**: Character Analysis shows actual pilot name

**Story 6: Navigation & Character Search (4 pts)**
- Add Character Analysis link to main navigation/index page
- Create character search form (accept name or ID input)  
- Handle character name → ID resolution for search
- **Definition of Done**: Users can navigate to and search for character analysis from main page

**Story 7: Port Configuration Fix (2 pts)**
- Investigate why app runs on 4000 instead of expected 4010
- Fix configuration or update documentation to match reality
- **Definition of Done**: Consistent port configuration across environments

**Story 8: Kill Feed Display Issues (4 pts)**
- Fix missing ship names on kill feed
- Fix missing location names 
- Fix missing pilot names
- **Definition of Done**: Kill feed shows proper names for ships, locations, pilots

**Story 9: EVE Image Service Integration (3 pts)**
- Add character portraits to Character Analysis page
- Add ship renders for preferred ships
- Add corp/alliance logos for external groups
- **Definition of Done**: Visual assets load from EVE image service

### LOW PRIORITY - Polish & Performance

**Story 10: Character Analysis Performance (2 pts)**
- Add caching for expensive character analysis queries
- Optimize database queries for better response time
- **Definition of Done**: Character analysis loads in <2 seconds

**Story 11: Enhanced Error Handling (2 pts)**
- Better error messages for invalid character IDs
- Graceful handling of characters with no data
- **Definition of Done**: Clear, helpful error messages

## 🔧 Technical Approach

### Building on Success
- **DON'T break what works**: Character Analysis MVP is solid foundation
- **Incremental enhancement**: Add one feature at a time, test each
- **Real data only**: Continue "no mock data" philosophy
- **Evidence-based**: Every feature must be manually verifiable

### Development Strategy
1. **Enhance existing queries** rather than rebuild
2. **Add features as separate functions** to avoid breaking working code
3. **Test each enhancement** with known character IDs
4. **Update UI incrementally** to show new data

---

## 📊 Reality Check Metrics

### Current Baseline (End of Sprint 1)
- ✅ **Character Analysis MVP**: Working with real data
- ✅ **Kill Feed**: Partially working (killmails display)
- ✅ **Authentication**: EVE SSO functional
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Database, Broadway pipeline operational

### Sprint 2 Target
- ✅ **Enhanced Character Analysis**: Complete tactical intelligence
- ✅ **Improved Kill Feed**: Proper name resolution
- ✅ **Better UX**: Visual assets and proper port configuration
- ✅ **Performance**: Sub-2-second analysis response time

---

## 🎯 Post-Sprint 2 Vision

After Sprint 2 completion, we'll have:
- **Complete Character Intelligence feature** with all planned analysis
- **Polished Kill Feed** with proper data display
- **Solid foundation** for Sprint 3 new features (Fleet Analysis, Surveillance, etc.)
- **Proven development process** that delivers real value incrementally

---

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Learnings from Sprint 1
- ✅ **Start simple**: MVP approach proved we can deliver value
- ✅ **Real data works**: Database queries provide accurate intelligence
- ✅ **Incremental is better**: Don't try to build everything at once
- ✅ **Test frequently**: Manual verification catches issues early

### Applying to Sprint 2
- Build each enhancement on the working foundation
- Test each feature with multiple character IDs
- Keep the "Real Data Source" verification on the UI
- Maintain evidence-based documentation

---

**Next Action**: Begin Story 1 (Ship + Weapon Preferences) to enhance our successful Character Analysis MVP.

**Sprint Motto**: "Build on success, fix what users see, prove continued capability"
