# Sprint 4: Corporation Intelligence MVP

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-09  
**End Date**: 2025-01-23  
**Sprint Goal**: Build working Corporation Intelligence feature with real member activity data  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done."

---

## üéØ Sprint Objective

### Primary Goal
Deliver a working Corporation Intelligence page that shows real member activity, killboard statistics, and basic analytics from actual killmail data.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Corporation page loads real member data from database
- [ ] Shows actual member activity metrics (kills, losses, ISK)
- [ ] Displays real timezone activity patterns
- [ ] Member list shows actual participation rates
- [ ] All data comes from killmails_raw table (no mocks)

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- ESI integration for corporation details (will use killmail data only)
- Advanced analytics (ship doctrines, fleet compositions)
- Member comparison features
- Historical trend analysis beyond basic activity
- Price/ISK valuation (unless simple implementation)

### Day 4 - January 12, 2025
- **Started**: Complete remaining Sprint 4 features and add caching layer
- **Completed**: 
  - ‚úÖ **CORP-6**: Activity heatmap component - Already implemented in corporation page as 24-hour activity distribution chart
  - ‚úÖ **CORP-7**: Basic caching layer for performance:
    - Created `EveDmv.Cache.AnalysisCache` - ETS-based cache with TTL and automatic cleanup
    - Supports both character and corporation analysis caching
    - Added cache integration to `CorporationLive` - caches expensive queries for 15 minutes
    - Added cache integration to `CharacterAnalysisLive` - caches analysis for 10 minutes  
    - Cache invalidation on refresh and proper error handling
    - Added to application supervision tree for automatic startup
    - Created `mix cache.stats` task for cache monitoring and management
  - **Character Analysis Enhancements**:
    - ‚úÖ Added intelligence summary to character analysis page header (peak activity, top location, primary TZ)
    - ‚úÖ Made recent fight partners clickable to corporation analysis pages
    - ‚úÖ Fixed weapon display regression showing IDs instead of names (now uses eve_item_types table)
  - **Bug Fixes**:
    - ‚úÖ Fixed partition manager runtime errors by removing killmails_enriched references

    - ‚úÖ Fixed compile warnings in KillmailQueries

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Key Queries Needed
1. **Member Activity Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT character_id, character_name, 
          COUNT(CASE WHEN is_victim = false THEN 1 END) as kills,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN is_victim = true THEN 1 END) as losses
   FROM participants p
   JOIN killmails_raw k ON p.killmail_id = k.killmail_id
   WHERE p.corporation_id = $1
   GROUP BY character_id, character_name
   ```

2. **Timezone Activity Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM killmail_time) as hour,
          COUNT(*) as activity_count
   FROM killmails_raw k
   JOIN participants p ON k.killmail_id = p.killmail_id
   WHERE p.corporation_id = $1
   GROUP BY hour
   ORDER BY hour
   ```

### Files to Update
- `lib/eve_dmv/contexts/corporation_analysis/domain/corporation_analyzer.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv_web/live/corporation_live.ex`
- `lib/eve_dmv_web/live/corporation_live.html.heex`

### Current Stub Returns to Replace
- `get_top_active_members/2` - Returns hardcoded list
- `get_activity_timeline/2` - Returns empty data
- `get_danger_assessment/1` - Returns fixed value
- `get_timezone_distribution/2` - Returns mock hours

**Remember**: Better to show real data for 5 members than fake data for 50 members.
