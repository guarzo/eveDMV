# Sprint 3: Runtime Error Fixes & Polish
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Started**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Sprint Goal
Fix runtime errors and polish Character Intelligence before adding new features.

## Completed Stories

### Story 1: Fix Participant Foreign Key Errors ✅
**Points**: 5 | **Status**: COMPLETED

**Problem**: Participant bulk inserts failing due to missing ship types
```
Key (ship_type_id)=(77114) is not present in table "eve_item_types"
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed foreign key constraint via migration
- Added index for performance
- Fixed static data loading (now have 49,894 items including ships)

**Files Changed**:
- `/workspace/priv/repo/migrations/20250108054000_remove_participant_ship_type_fk.exs`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/eve/static_data_loader/item_type_processor.ex`

### Story 2: Character Intel UI/UX Polish ✅  
**Points**: 8 | **Status**: COMPLETED

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added character portraits with correct image URLs
- ✅ Added corp/alliance logos for flight partners
- ✅ Added ship images for preferred ships
- ✅ Combined ship and weapon usage cards
- ✅ Fixed "Most Active Day" and "Days Active" calculations
- ✅ Removed debug labels and duplicate IDs
- ✅ Fixed N/A and TBD placeholder values

**Key Discovery**: Found duplicate pages at `/intel/:character_id` and `/analysis/:character_id`. Removed the intel route and fixed the correct page.

**Files Changed**:
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv_web/components/eve_image_components.ex` (created)
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv_web/live/character_analysis_live.ex`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv_web/router.ex`

### Story 3: Simplify Enriched/Raw Architecture ✅
**Points**: 13 | **Status**: COMPLETED

**Analysis**: 
- Enriched table provided no value (all enrichment fields empty/zero)
- No UI components used the enriched table
- Just duplicate data causing errors

**Implementation**:
1. **Phase 1**: Stopped writing to enriched table ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Removed all enriched code ✅
   - Removed `KillmailEnriched` resource
   - Removed enriched insertion functions
   - Cleaned up transformers and processors
   - Removed unused helper functions
3. **Phase 3**: Dropped enriched table via migration ✅
   - Also dropped dependent materialized views

**Files Changed**:
- `/workspace/docs/architecture/enriched-raw-analysis.md` (created)
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/killmails/killmail_pipeline.ex`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/api.ex`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/killmails/database_inserter.ex`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/killmails/data_processor.ex`
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/killmails/killmail_data_transformer.ex`
- `/workspace/priv/repo/migrations/20250708174743_drop_enriched_killmails_table.exs`
- Archived: `killmail_enriched.ex`, `enriched_participant_loader.ex`

### Story 7: Static Data Completeness ✅
**Points**: 3 | **Status**: COMPLETED (Part of Story 1)

**Fixed**:
- CSV parser was only accepting "1" as true for published field
- Removed published filter entirely per user request
- Added safety checks for numeric overflow
- Now have 49,894 items loaded (including 535 ships)

### Story 4: Error Monitoring & Alerting ✅
**Points**: 2 | **Status**: COMPLETED

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Added structured telemetry logging for missing ship types
- ✅ Created MissingDataTracker module to collect statistics
- ✅ Enhanced monitoring dashboard with:
  - Missing ship types count and table
  - Pipeline throughput metrics
  - System uptime tracking
  - Data quality metrics section
- ✅ Integrated telemetry events for real-time tracking

**Files Changed**:
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/killmails/participant_builder.ex` - Added telemetry events
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/monitoring/missing_data_tracker.ex` - New tracking module
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv/monitoring/error_recovery_supervisor.ex` - Added tracker to supervision
- `/workspace/lib/eve_dmv_web/live/monitoring_dashboard_live.ex` - Enhanced dashboard UI

## Sprint Metrics

- **Total Points Completed**: 31/30 ✅
- **Stories Completed**: 5/8 (all high/medium priority)
- **Runtime Errors Fixed**: 2 major error patterns eliminated
- **Code Quality**: Significantly simplified architecture
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive error and data quality tracking

## Key Achievements

1. **No More Foreign Key Violations**: Participants insert reliably
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed entire enriched table layer
3. **Polished UI**: Character Analysis page now shows real data with proper images
4. **Clean Codebase**: Removed ~500 lines of unused enrichment code

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ✅ Removed duplicate page confusion (intel vs analysis)
- ✅ Fixed static data loading issues
- ✅ Eliminated enriched table complexity
- ✅ Cleaned up unused functions and imports

## What's Next

### Remaining Stories (for future sprints):
- **Story 4**: Error Monitoring & Alerting
- **Story 5**: Performance Optimization  
- **Story 6**: Add Character Intel Features
- **Story 8**: Documentation & Testing

### Recommendations:
1. Continue with incremental improvements
2. Add real enrichment only when needed (e.g., price APIs)
3. Focus on one complete feature at a time
4. Keep architecture simple

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simpler is Better**: Removing the enriched table eliminated complexity without losing functionality
2. **Fix Root Causes**: Static data issues were causing downstream problems
3. **User Feedback Matters**: Discovery of duplicate pages came from user confusion
4. **Incremental Progress**: Fixing errors first enabled smoother feature development
