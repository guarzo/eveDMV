- **Dependencies**: Stable battle analysis system (✅ completed)
- **Potential Sprint**: Sprint 8 or later

### Advanced Tactical AI Recommendations
- **Description**: ML-powered tactical analysis and recommendations
- **Complexity**: Very High - requires ML model training, tactical knowledge base
- **Estimated Points**: 21-34
- **Dependencies**: Battle metrics system (✅ completed), large dataset
- **Potential Sprint**: Sprint 9 or later (needs research phase)

### Multi-System Battle Tracking
- **Description**: Track battles that span multiple solar systems
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires enhanced clustering algorithm
- **Estimated Points**: 8-13
- **Dependencies**: Single-system battle detection (✅ completed)
