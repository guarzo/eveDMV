# Archived Sprint Documentation

**⚠️ WARNING: These documents are historical artifacts from the initial development phase where features were marked as "complete" but were actually implemented with placeholder/mock data.**

## Context

These sprint documents were created during the initial development of EVE DMV when the project followed an overly ambitious sprint planning approach. The documents claim completion of numerous features that were actually implemented as stubs returning hardcoded values.

## Why These Are Archived

During the "Reality Check Sprint 1" (January 2025), we conducted an honest assessment and discovered:
- ~80% of claimed features were returning mock data
- Most "completed" stories were placeholder implementations
- The UI existed but wasn't connected to real data

## Current Sprint Approach

The project has since adopted a reality-based approach where:
- Features are only marked complete when they query real data
- No placeholder values are accepted as "done"
- Each sprint focuses on making a few features actually work

## Files in This Archive

- `sprint-2.md` through `sprint-6.md` - Old sprint plans claiming 100+ story points completed
- `sprint-*-bug-fixes.md` - Bug fixes for features that never actually worked
- `sprint-*.5.md` - Mid-sprint additions that were never implemented
