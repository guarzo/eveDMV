# Sprint 4: Wormhole Corporation Management

**Duration**: 2 weeks (Weeks 7-8)  
**Total Points**: 19 points  
**Theme**: WH Corp Excellence

## Sprint Overview

Building on Sprint 3's chain-wide surveillance foundation, Sprint 4 focuses on providing wormhole corporations with comprehensive management tools. This sprint delivers advanced vetting capabilities, home defense analytics, and fleet composition tools specifically designed for the unique challenges of wormhole space.

## Context from Previous Sprints

**Sprint 1**: ✅ Data Foundation (30 pts) - Core infrastructure and real-time pipeline
