# Sprint Planning Template & Management Guide

**Use this template for every sprint to maintain reality-based development**

## ü§ñ AI Sprint Management Prompt

When starting a new sprint or closing a previous one, use this prompt:

```
I need to manage the sprint transition for EVE DMV. Please help me:

1. CLOSE PREVIOUS SPRINT:
   - Review /workspace/docs/sprints/current/[SPRINT_NAME].md
   - Update the sprint document with final status, metrics, and retrospective
   - Move it to /workspace/docs/sprints/completed/
   - Update /workspace/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md with sprint results
   - Update /workspace/PROJECT_STATUS.md if major features were completed

2. START NEW SPRINT:
   - Create new sprint document in /workspace/docs/sprints/current/SPRINT_[NUMBER]_[NAME].md
   - Use the template below to structure the sprint
   - Update /workspace/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md with new sprint info
   - Create initial todo list for tracking

3. VERIFY DOCUMENTATION:
   - Ensure no placeholder features are marked as "complete"
   - Update feature status in README.md if needed
   - Archive any outdated documents

Current sprint number: [X]
Previous sprint: [Name and status]
New sprint focus: [Battle Analysis / Corporation Intelligence / Performance / etc.]

## üìÅ Sprint Management Procedures

### Starting a Sprint
1. Copy this template to `/workspace/docs/sprints/current/SPRINT_[X]_[NAME].md`
2. Update `/workspace/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` with new sprint info
3. Create todo list using TodoWrite tool
4. Review previous sprint's retrospective
5. Hold sprint planning meeting

### During the Sprint
1. Update sprint document daily with progress
2. Conduct mid-sprint review on Day 7
3. Update todo items as completed
4. Capture evidence (screenshots, test results)
5. Flag any scope changes immediately

### Closing a Sprint
1. Complete all sections of sprint document
2. Run through completion checklist
3. Conduct retrospective
4. Move document to `/workspace/docs/sprints/completed/`
5. Update all project status documents
6. Archive any outdated documentation

### Documentation Updates Required
- `/workspace/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - Add sprint summary
- `/workspace/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Update feature status
- `/workspace/README.md` - Update if major features added
- `/workspace/docs/README.md` - Update if docs structure changed

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Claiming Completion Without Evidence**
   - Always require screenshots or demo
   - Test in actual browser, not just unit tests

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Explicitly list what's NOT in scope
   - Resist adding "just one more thing"

3. **Ignoring Technical Debt**
   - Track it, plan for it
   - Don't let it accumulate silently

4. **Overestimating Capacity**
   - Use actual velocity from previous sprints
   - Account for meetings, reviews, testing

5. **Documentation Drift**
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Remove outdated information immediately

---

**Remember**: Better to complete 3 features that actually work than claim 10 features are "done" with mock data.
