7. **Real-time Price Updates**
   - Automatic price monitoring with 5% change threshold
   - PubSub broadcasting for connected clients
   - Price Monitor component on dashboard
   - Integrated with re-enrichment worker

8. **Enhanced Surveillance System**
   - Batch profile management tools
   - Multi-select operations (enable/disable/delete)
