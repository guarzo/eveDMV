# Credo Fix Workstreams

This directory contains focused workstreams for fixing all 930 Credo errors in the EVE DMV codebase. Each workstream targets specific error types with clear implementation instructions.

## Overview

Total Errors: **930 across 398 files**

### Workstream Summary

| Workstream | Errors | Complexity | Time | Impact |
|------------|--------|------------|------|--------|
| [01 Module Organization](01_module_organization.md) | 380 (41%) | Low | 2-3h | Automated fixes, import ordering |
| [02 Pipeline Refactoring](02_pipeline_refactoring.md) | 250 (27%) | Medium | 3-4h | Readability improvement |
| [03 Error Handling](03_error_handling.md) | 80 (8.6%) | Medium-High | 4-5h | Modern error patterns |
| [04 Variable Cleanup](04_variable_cleanup.md) | 70 (7.5%) | Medium | 3-4h | Logic clarity |
| [05 Quick Style Fixes](05_quick_style_fixes.md) | 100 (10.7%) | Low | 1-2h | Number formatting, whitespace |
| [06 Code Duplication](06_code_duplication.md) | 15 (1.6%) | High | 4-6h | Shared utilities |
| **Remaining** | 35 (3.8%) | Various | 2h | Misc issues |

**Total Time Estimate**: 20-28 hours

## Recommended Execution Order

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (4-5 hours)
1. **[Workstream 5](05_quick_style_fixes.md)** - Style fixes (1-2h)
   - Automated number formatting
   - Whitespace cleanup
   - @impl annotations
   
2. **[Workstream 1](01_module_organization.md)** - Module organization (2-3h)
   - Alias alphabetization
   - Import/require ordering
   - Automated script available

**Impact**: 480 errors fixed (52% reduction)

### Phase 2: Code Quality (7-8 hours)
3. **[Workstream 2](02_pipeline_refactoring.md)** - Pipeline refactoring (3-4h)
   - Single-function pipelines
   - Pipe chain improvements
   
4. **[Workstream 4](04_variable_cleanup.md)** - Variable cleanup (3-4h)
   - Variable redeclaration
   - Naming improvements

**Impact**: 320 additional errors fixed (86% total reduction)

### Phase 3: Architecture (8-11 hours)
5. **[Workstream 3](03_error_handling.md)** - Error handling (4-5h)
   - Modern error patterns
   - Implicit try usage
   
6. **[Workstream 6](06_code_duplication.md)** - Code duplication (4-6h)
   - Extract shared modules
   - DRY principle

**Impact**: 95 additional errors fixed (96% total reduction)

## Success Metrics

### After Each Phase
- **Phase 1**: 450 errors remaining (52% reduction)
- **Phase 2**: 130 errors remaining (86% reduction)  
- **Phase 3**: 35 errors remaining (96% reduction)

### Final State
- Clean codebase with <5% of original errors
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Consistent code style
- Better error handling
- Reduced duplication

## Implementation Tips

1. **Use Automation First**
   - Run automated fixes before manual work
   - Test after each automated change
   
2. **Work Module by Module**
   - Complete one file before moving to next
   - Run tests frequently
   
3. **Preserve Functionality**
   - Refactoring should not change behavior
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

4. **Document Decisions**
   - Note any intentional style deviations
   - Update team coding standards

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check overall progress
mix credo --strict | tail -10

# Check specific workstream progress
mix credo --strict | grep -c "pattern from workstream"

# Ensure nothing broke
mix compile --warnings-as-errors && mix test
```

## Team Coordination

For teams working in parallel:

- **Workstreams 1 & 5**: Can be done simultaneously (different error types)
- **Workstreams 2 & 4**: Can be done simultaneously (different files typically)
- **Workstreams 3 & 6**: Should be done after others (more complex)

Each workstream is independent and can be assigned to different team members.

## Next Steps

1. Review each workstream document
2. Set up automation scripts
3. Assign workstreams to team members
4. Track progress in project management tool
5. Schedule code review sessions

The goal is a clean, consistent, and maintainable codebase with zero Credo errors.
