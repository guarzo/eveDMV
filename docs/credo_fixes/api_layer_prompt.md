# API Layer Code Quality Fixes

## Issues Overview - UPDATED
- **Error Count**: No excessive dependency errors currently found in API layer
- **Status**: This error category appears to have been resolved
- **Current Focus**: Code formatting and style issues

## AI Assistant Prompt

Based on the latest credo analysis, the API layer excessive dependency issue has been resolved. Focus on:

1. **Code Formatting**: Address any trailing whitespace or formatting issues
2. **Import Organization**: Ensure aliases are properly ordered and grouped
3. **Pipeline Style**: Convert single-function pipelines to direct function calls
4. **Documentation**: Ensure @impl annotations are specific rather than `@impl true`

## Current Status

The original excessive dependency error in `lib/eve_dmv/api.ex` is no longer present in the current credo report. The module appears to have been refactored successfully.

## Maintenance Tasks

If working in API-related files, ensure:
- Proper alias ordering (alias before require)
- No grouped aliases in `{ ... }` format
- Specific @impl annotations
- No trailing whitespace
- Proper file endings with final newline
