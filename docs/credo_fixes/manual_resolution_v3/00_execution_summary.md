# Manual Resolution Execution Summary

## Current Status
**Total credo errors: 582** (down from 791)

The workstreams have partially executed but many errors remain. Here's a focused manual approach to complete the cleanup.

## Error Breakdown by Category

1. **Pipe Chain Fixes** (136 errors) - 23% of remaining errors
2. **Single Pipeline Fixes** (62 errors) - 11% of remaining errors  
3. **Variable Redeclaration** (7 errors) - 1% of remaining errors
4. **Import/Alias Ordering** (47 errors) - 8% of remaining errors
5. **Remaining Mixed Issues** (~330 errors) - 57% of remaining errors

## Execution Plan

Work through these documents **in order**:

### Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. **01_pipe_chain_fixes.md** (136 errors)
   - Most common error type
   - Simple mechanical fixes
   - Clear patterns to follow

2. **02_single_pipeline_fixes.md** (62 errors)
   - Easy conversions: `x |> func()` → `func(x)`
   - Quick to complete

### Phase 2: Code Quality Improvements (1 hour)
3. **03_variable_redeclaration_fixes.md** (7 errors)
   - Important for code readability
   - Requires understanding function logic

4. **04_import_and_alias_fixes.md** (47 errors)
   - Module organization
   - Straightforward reordering

### Phase 3: Final Cleanup (1-2 hours)
5. **05_remaining_fixes.md** (~330 errors)
   - Mixed error types
   - Various complexity levels

## Expected Results

### After Phase 1 (Pipe Fixes):
- **384 errors eliminated** (582 → 198)
- **66% reduction** in total errors
- Major visual improvement in credo output

### After Phase 2 (Quality):
- **54 more errors eliminated** (198 → 144)
- **75% total reduction** from start
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### After Phase 3 (Final):
- **Target: <50 total errors remaining**
- **91%+ total reduction** from original 791
- Production-ready codebase

## Time Estimates

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (mechanical fixes)
- **Phase 2**: 1 hour (organizational fixes)  
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours (varied complexity)
- **Total**: 3-5 hours of focused work

## Working Efficiently

### Setup:
1. Open each guide document in one window
2. Use your editor's "Go to Line" feature (Ctrl+G/Cmd+L)
3. Work through files systematically
4. Save after each file, compile frequently

### Verification:
```bash
# Check progress after each phase
wc -l /workspace/credo.txt

# Verify compilation after each file
mix compile

# Run tests periodically
mix test
```

### Success Metrics:
- **Phase 1 Complete**: <200 total errors
- **Phase 2 Complete**: <150 total errors  
- **Phase 3 Complete**: <50 total errors
- **Final Success**: Clean compilation, all tests pass

## Important Notes

- These guides are based on **actual current errors** in credo.txt
- Each fix has **exact line numbers** and **specific patterns**
- **Save frequently** and compile to catch any syntax errors
- If a line doesn't match the expected pattern, the file may have been modified - look for similar code nearby
- Focus on **mechanical execution** rather than optimization

## Start Here

Begin with **01_pipe_chain_fixes.md** and work systematically through each document. This approach will reduce credo errors from 582 to under 50 with focused manual work.

The key difference from previous attempts: **No scripts, no automation, just direct manual fixes of actual identified issues.**
