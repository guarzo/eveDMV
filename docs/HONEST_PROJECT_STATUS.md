# EVE DMV - Honest Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 8, 2025  
**Current State**: Reality Check Sprint 1 (Week 1 Complete)  
**Philosophy**: "If it returns mock data, it's not done. If it's not done, don't ship it."

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

After comprehensive codebase audit, the EVE DMV project has **~15% actual functionality** versus the previously claimed 84+ story points. This document provides an honest assessment of what actually works vs. what was placeholder code.

**Key Finding**: ~80% of previously "completed" features were returning mock/hardcoded data instead of real implementation.

## 📊 Reality Dashboard

### Implementation Status
- **Actually Working**: ~15%
- **Placeholder/Stub**: ~80% 
- **Broken/Incomplete**: ~5%

### Test Suite Status
- **Tests Passing**: 327/327 ✅
- **Integration Tests**: 15 added to validate stub behavior
- **Test Coverage**: Honest (tests don't claim mock data works)

### Documentation Status
- **Previous Claims**: 84+ story points "completed"
- **Actual Status**: ~12-15 story points of real functionality
- **Honesty Gap**: ~70+ points of claimed but unimplemented features

---

## 🔧 Current Reality Check Sprint 1

### Week 1 Completed ✅
- ✅ Audited all stub implementations
- ✅ Updated stubs to return `:not_implemented` instead of mock data
- ✅ Fixed Broadway pipeline bugs
- ✅ Eliminated all runtime warnings (25+ fixes)
- ✅ Added PostgreSQL extensions via migration
- ✅ Fixed test suite to handle `:not_implemented` responses
- ✅ Created honest project documentation

### Week 2 Plan
- Day 9-10: Complete remaining service error updates
- Day 11: Final test suite validation
- Day 12: Update all documentation to reflect reality
- Day 13: Plan Character Intelligence MVP (first real feature)
- Day 14: Manual testing and verification

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: Character Intelligence MVP

### Proposed Sprint 2: "First Real Feature"
**Goal**: Build ONE complete character intelligence feature from scratch  
**Duration**: 2 weeks

**Candidate Features** (pick one):
1. **Character Combat Analysis** - Real killmail analysis with actual stats
2. **Character Corporation History** - ESI-based corp tracking  
3. **Character Activity Patterns** - Timezone and activity analysis

**Success Criteria**:
- Feature works with real EVE data (no mocks)
- Full database integration with actual queries
- Working UI with real-time updates
- Complete test coverage with real scenarios
- Performance optimized for production use
- Documentation matches implementation exactly

---

## 🚨 Critical Development Rules

### Definition of "Done"
A feature is **ONLY** considered done when:
1. ✅ It queries real data from the database
2. ✅ Calculations use actual algorithms (no hardcoded values)
3. ✅ No placeholder/mock return values
4. ✅ Tests exist and pass with real data
5. ✅ Documentation matches actual implementation
6. ✅ No TODO comments in the implementation
7. ✅ Manual testing confirms it works in browser

### Development Philosophy
- **Evidence beats claims every time**
- **Better to complete 1 feature fully than claim 10 features are "90% done"**
- **If it returns mock data, it's not done**
- **Documentation must match implementation exactly**

---

## 📋 Technical Architecture (What Actually Works)

### Application Stack
- **Framework**: Phoenix 1.7.21 with LiveView ✅
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Ash Framework ✅
- **Real-time**: Broadway pipeline + Server-Sent Events ✅
- **Authentication**: EVE SSO OAuth2 ✅
- **Data Source**: wanderer-kills SSE feed ✅

### Data Pipeline
1. **Killmail Ingestion**: SSE → Broadway → Database ✅
2. **Static Data**: EVE SDE → ETS cache ✅
3. **Authentication**: EVE SSO → Session storage ✅

### What's Missing (Everything Else)
- All analysis algorithms
- All intelligence features  
- All market intelligence
- All wormhole-specific features
- All battle analysis
- All surveillance features

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify what actually works
mix phx.server                    # Start server
open http://localhost:4010/feed   # See real killmail feed

# Verify static data is loaded
psql -h db -U postgres -d eve_tracker_gamma -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM eve_item_types; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM eve_solar_systems;"

# Verify tests pass
MIX_ENV=test mix test

# Verify no compilation warnings
mix compile 2>&1 | grep -c "warning:"  # Should return 0
```

---

## 📝 Summary

EVE DMV has solid technical infrastructure but minimal user-facing functionality. The foundation is strong:
- Real-time data pipeline works
- Database architecture is sound  
- Authentication system is functional
- Test suite is comprehensive and honest

**Next milestone**: Build our first complete, real feature to prove we can deliver value on this foundation.

**Timeline**: 2-week Character Intelligence MVP to demonstrate end-to-end capability
