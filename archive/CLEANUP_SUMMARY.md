# Cleanup Summary

Date: $(date)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Archive Structure
- `/workspace/archive/` - Main archive directory
- `/workspace/archive/refactoring_scripts/` - Contains all refactoring scripts
- `/workspace/archive/credo_output/` - Contains Credo analysis outputs
- `/workspace/archive/backup_libs/` - Contains lib directory backups

### 2. Moved Refactoring Scripts
Moved all temporary scripts used during refactoring:
- Shell scripts (*.sh) - Various automated fix scripts
- Python scripts (*.py) - Complex refactoring tools
- Elixir scripts (fix_*.exs) - Direct code manipulation scripts

### 3. Moved Documentation
- `INTELLIGENCE_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` → `/docs/architecture/`
- `DOMAIN_DRIVEN_DESIGN_*.md` → `/docs/architecture/`
- `ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW_2024.md` → `/docs/architecture/`
- `feedback.md` → `/docs/project-management/`
- `next.md` → `/docs/project-management/`

### 4. Archived Analysis Output
- All `credo*.txt` files → `/archive/credo_output/`
- `dialyzer.txt` → `/archive/`
- `coverage_summary.json` → `/archive/`

### 5. Archived Backups
- `lib_backup_aliases_*` → `/archive/backup_libs/`
- `lib_backup_impl_*` → `/archive/backup_libs/`
- `lib_backup_imports_*` → `/archive/backup_libs/`

### 6. Removed Temporary Files
- `erl_crash.dump` - Deleted

### 7. Moved Test Scripts
- `test_intelligence_engine.exs` → `/test/manual/`

## Final Root Directory State
The root directory now contains only essential project files:
- Configuration files (mix.exs, package.json, docker-compose.yml, etc.)
- Documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, TODO.md)
- Build file (Makefile)
- Container file (Dockerfile)

All temporary files from refactoring have been properly archived or moved to appropriate directories.
